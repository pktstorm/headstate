  // and there is a cached list to show while it arrives.
  //
  // On `IS_MOBILE_BUILD`, not `useIsMobile()`: whether this app can

  // `offline` joins `!isLoading` for the same reason `PairingGate`
  // dismisses on every terminal state: an offline phone is about to
  // render a real screen -- the cached list -- and a fixed inset-0
  // z-index-9999 overlay left over it would hide that screen. Without

  // away from its desk was an empty `#0d1117` window (#684).
  //
  // Letting the children through is not a guess that the desktop is

  // the desktop and when it was last seen, `StaleRibbon` already marks

  // disables the actions that would need the desktop. Those three are
  // the honest, proportionate report, and they are already built. The
  // rule from #602 -- cached data is MARKED, not hidden -- is the same
  // rule one layer up: unreachable must not mean blank.

  // snapshot, so there is genuinely something to show. Where there is
  // not, `PrList` renders its own empty state, which is honest too.
