                  fix this should have inherited (#852).

                  It was `shrink-0` with no width bound, which on a flex
                  row means "claim my full intrinsic width and give none
                  of it back". The target was the only `flex-1` cell, so
                  it absorbed all the pressure: a `refused` entry reading
                  "could not remove … Device or resource busy" collapsed
                  the path to nothing, and the user could not tell WHICH
                  item the ledger was discussing -- on the surface that
                  exists to audit what cleanup deleted.

                  `flex-auto` rather than `flex-1` for the basis, for
                  `WorktreesPage`'s reason: `flex-1` is `flex: 1 1 0%` and
                  would give the reason an equal share of the row however
                  short it is, leaving a two-word refusal sitting in a
                  half-row of whitespace. `flex-auto` is `flex: 1 1 auto`
                  -- sized from its content, as it effectively was while
                  `shrink-0`, and the only change is that it can now give
                  width back under pressure.

                  The priority is deliberate: of the two variable cells
                  the reason is the more expendable, because it is a
                  SENTENCE whose first clause carries the decision and
                  whose tail is elaboration, while the target is an
                  identifier. A clipped sentence still reads; half a path
                  does not.

                  And a `title`, which the advisory had none of -- so
                  clipped text was unrecoverable, worse than on the
                  worktree row where #818 at least left a tooltip. */}
