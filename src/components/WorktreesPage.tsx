          In practice this branch is unreachable for the button, which

          verdict tells the user their answer is old and leaves them only
          one way to get a new one -- Update, which performs the merge.
          So finding out whether you were behind required ceasing to be
          behind, and a user who only wanted to know had to accept a
          change to their working tree to find out. This separates the
          question from the answer.

          NOT disabled on a dirty tree, unlike Update beside it, and that
          difference is the whole point: `git fetch` writes only
          remote-tracking refs, so uncommitted work is not at risk and
          there is nothing for it to conflict with. A dirty main checkout
          is in fact the case where this matters most -- it is the one
          where Update is refused outright, which until now left the row
          with no way to refresh its own verdict at all.

          Placed BEFORE Update rather than after, because it is the
          cheaper and more reversible of the two and reads as the step you
          take first. A row's one-action rule is not broken here: Update
          is still the primary action and this renders only on the main

  // SORTING VS STREAMING (#771).
  //
  // Sizes land progressively (#754, #758), so a live size sort re-orders
  // rows under the cursor: the row you were reaching for slides away as
  // some other row's `du` returns. On this page that is not a cosmetic
  // annoyance -- the button it moves out from under you removes a
  // directory -- so a silent live re-sort is the one option that is
  // genuinely unsafe.
  //
  // The previous code answered this by refusing to sort at all until
  // every size was in, which is why the page could sit in path order for
  // two minutes with nothing to explain it.
  //
  // So: sort on the values known when the sort was CHOSEN, and re-sort
  // only on an explicit gesture. `sortedAt` is that gesture's clock --
  // picking a sort takes a fresh snapshot, and clicking "re-sort" takes
  // another. Between gestures the ORDER is frozen while each row's
  // displayed size keeps updating live, so a landing measurement is
  // never hidden; it simply does not move anything.
  //
  // What is memoised is the ORDER ALONE -- a list of paths -- and not
  // the rows themselves. Freezing the rows would freeze their contents
  // too, so a size landing after the snapshot would stay invisible
  // behind its skeleton until the next gesture. That is the opposite of
  // the intent: the number is never withheld, only its power to move
  // the row is.
  //
  // `orderKey` is the only dependency that may bump the memo, since the
  // freshly-built `withSizes` array is a new reference on every render
  // and listing it would restore exactly the live re-ordering this
  // exists to prevent. `length` rides along so a worktree appearing or
  // disappearing is not silently dropped from the list.
  //
  // THE FIRST BURST IS NOT A GESTURE TO PROTECT (#817).
  //
  // `settledAt` joins the clock, and the distinction it draws is the
  // whole of that issue's second complaint. Everything above is about
  // not moving a row out from under a user who CHOSE an order. On
  // arrival nobody has chosen anything: the default is "largest first",
  // and the first measurements necessarily land after the mount, so the
  // page used to greet a user who had touched nothing with "re-sort --
  // 94 newly measured". That is not honesty about a frozen order, it is
  // the page confessing that data arrived.
  //
  // There is also nothing to protect at that moment. The hazard is a
  // button sliding out from under a cursor that is already reaching for
  // it; during the initial burst the rows are still filling in their
  // skeletons and there is no considered click in flight to spoil.
  //
  // So the snapshot is re-taken ONCE, when the first sizing pass for
  // this repository settles, and the button thereafter means "things
  // changed since YOU chose" rather than "data arrived". Crucially this
  // is one bump, not a subscription to `sizing`: a clock that moved on
  // every pass would re-sort the list on each background refetch, which
  // is exactly the live re-ordering the paragraphs above call the one

            measured." Here the same mistake is worse, because the figure
            beside it is a count of directories the user is invited to
            delete. A pass where 9 of 111 worktrees could not be
            classified finishes with `pending` at zero and a confident
            green "102 safe to remove", and nothing on screen would say
            that 9 rows were never answered.

            So it sits NEXT TO the green count rather than inside it, and
            it is amber rather than red: these are not failures of the
            app, they are questions git could not answer in the time
            allowed, and each row already says so in its own words. The
            number exists so the green count cannot be read as covering
            the whole repository.

            Silent at zero, like every other conditional count in this
            row -- a permanent "0 could not be checked" is furniture. */}

            "12 stale registrations" is not a subset of "safe to remove"
            and must not read as one: there is no directory behind these,
            so they are not disk to reclaim and the Remove button is
            rightly disabled on them. That part of #793 stands, and so does
            the separate count.

            What changed is the COLOUR. Grey beside a green "N safe to
            remove" made the second number read as a caveat on the first --
            a warning, or a leftover the green count had declined to
            vouch for. Both are clearable and only the verb differs, so the
            shade must not be what carries the difference; the word
            "clear" does instead. The issue was filed twice, which is the
            signal that a correct distinction had become an invisible one.

            Green does NOT claim Remove works here. It means "nothing is
            stopping you getting rid of this", which is as true of a
            dangling registration as of a merged worktree -- more so, since
            nothing can be lost. The button beside it names the verb, and
            `isSafe` still excludes the kind, so nothing about the action
            has widened.

            there. The dialog lists the paths, so the bulk action is
            reviewed once rather than not at all.

            are the fix for #817.

            The re-sort button used to sit directly before the bulk
            "Remove N safe worktrees" button in this `flex flex-wrap`
            row. So an ADVISORY control appearing -- which it does on its
            own schedule, as measurements and assessments land -- pushed a
            DESTRUCTIVE control sideways or onto a second line. That is
            the same hazard the frozen row order exists to prevent,
            reproduced one level up in the toolbar: a thing that deletes
            directories must not move because something else arrived.

            Grouping it with the Sort select fixed the ADJACENCY, and it
            is where the button belongs -- it does nothing but re-run what
            the select chose. But grouping alone did not fix the
            DISPLACEMENT, which is what the reporter actually asked for
            ("it shouldn't displace everything"): the group is still a
            flex item in the same wrapping row, and it still sits where it
            sat, so a button appearing inside it widens the group and
            pushes everything after it along. The structural test that
            shipped with it asserted only that the two buttons are not
            siblings, which is true and insufficient.

            Ordering is what actually settles it. With the group after
            Remove, nothing upstream of Remove changes width when the
            button appears, disappears, or changes its count -- so Remove
            cannot move, by construction rather than by tuning. That is
            stronger than reserving a fixed slot, the other option the
            issue offered: a reserved slot holds a permanent gap on a
            toolbar that is usually complete without it, and it only
            stops the two from moving rather than stopping them from being
            neighbours.

            The cost is that Sort is no longer the last control before
            "All repositories". Worth it: Sort is advisory and idempotent,
            Remove deletes directories, and when only one of them can hold
            a stable position it is not the advisory one.

            `shrink-0` so the group is not what the toolbar compresses,
            and no `flex-wrap` inside it: the button belongs to the
            select, and a wrap between them would read as two unrelated
            controls. */}

              Rows are ordered on what was known when the sort was

          The fix is that every cell in a row can now yield; this is what
          happens if some future cell cannot. Without it the border is
          decoration that content walks straight through: the row that
          reported this issue rendered its Remove button and kebab
          outside the box entirely, to the right of the border, where
          they looked like they belonged to nothing. With it, an
          unbounded cell degrades to being clipped at the edge -- still
          wrong, but visibly wrong inside the frame instead of silently
          scattering controls across the page.

          Clipping rather than `overflow-x-auto`: a horizontal
          scrollbar on the list would mean the action buttons can be
          scrolled OUT of view, and the whole complaint was that they
          were unreachable. `rounded-md` also only actually rounds the
          first and last rows' corners once the box clips them. */}
