/// Seven cards. Five are derived from the PR list already in memory and
/// cost no request -- the Rust `get_stats` command always returns zero for
/// them (see `deriveStats` in `@/lib/derive`). Only the two historical
/// counters, `merged_week`/`merged_month`, come from GitHub via
/// `useStats()`.
///
/// Every card is a triage entry point: clicking calls `applyPreset`, which
/// *replaces* the whole filter set and switches to the list view in one
/// atomic update. That's deliberate, not incidental -- a card click must
/// never inherit a filter the user forgot was active, or the number on the
/// card would disagree with what the list then shows. See `applyPreset` in
/// `@/store/filters`.
///
/// `applyPreset` does not carry over `filters.sort`, so every card click
/// resets sort to `sortPrs`'s default ("newest"). That's intentional: this
/// is a triage view, and "what's newest in this bucket" is the useful
/// starting order regardless of what the list was previously sorted by.
///
/// The two historical cards ("merged this week/month") have no
/// corresponding filter -- `usePullRequests()` only ever holds *open* PRs,
/// and `Filters` has no merged/state predicate, so there is no preset that
/// represents "PRs merged this week." Clicking them clears filters back to
/// the full open list (`applyPreset({})`) rather than doing nothing.
