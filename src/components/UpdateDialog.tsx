            The error path beside it has `role="alert"` and this had
            nothing -- so the operation that REPLACES AND RESTARTS THE APP
            reported its progress to sighted users only. A bundle is ~20 MB
            and long enough on a slow connection that a dialog with no
            feedback reads as hung; a reader who cannot see it had no
            feedback at all, not even the line saying the install had
            started.

            Always mounted rather than wrapped in `busy`, which is the rule
            `StatusBar` states: "A live region has to exist before the text
            appears or the first announcement is missed -- the one that
            matters most, since it is the one saying work started." Here
            that announcement is the whole point -- the user has just
            pressed Install on something that will close the app under
            them, and "Downloading…" is the confirmation that it took.

            `polite` rather than `assertive`: a percentage must not
            interrupt, and the same choice is made in the status bar for
            the same reason. The error beside it keeps `role="alert"`,
            which is assertive, and that asymmetry is correct -- a refused
            update is news, a progressing one is not. */}
