/// eight and GitHub refused three of them (#752).

/// it: "3 already in the merge queue" is something a user can check
/// their selection against, where a count of skipped rows is not.
///

/// pull requests, so `close` is never redundant; `draft` on a PR that is
/// already a draft would be, but the bar offers "Convert to draft"
