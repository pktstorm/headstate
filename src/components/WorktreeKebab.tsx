/// leaves on a timer or on a stray click, and nothing about it says it

  // The detached row needs no wiring of its own here, which is the
  // argument for routing #819 through `isSafe` rather than through a new
  // predicate: a row that is provably contained in the default branch
  // wants the same route for the same reason, and one gate means the
  // menu and the primary button cannot disagree about it (#770).

  //
  // The REASON changed in #798 while the behaviour did not. It used to
  // be that `remove_worktree_forced` never passed git's `--force` at
  // all, so forcing a locked tree failed the same way forcing a dirty
  // one did -- an implementation gap, now closed.
  //
  // What remains is a decision. Git wants `--force --force` for a lock
  // and Headstate passes it once, on purpose: the lock is the only
  // mechanism another process has for saying "I am using this
  // directory", and 13 of 34 worktrees on the reporting machine were
  // locked by agents actively working in them. Double-forcing would
  // tear a directory out from under whatever holds it, so the route is
  // an explicit unlock -- the item directly above, behind a
  // confirmation that names the holder and the age (#775).
  //
  // So git still refuses, and without this line the user confirms a
  // destructive-sounding dialog and gets an error. `forceWarning` owns
  // that sentence for #753's confirmation, so it is reused rather than
  // reworded: two copies of a warning about an unrecoverable action are
  // two chances to drift.

  //
  // An ORPHAN has no repository for git to run in, so it is removed by
  // an entirely different call -- the Rust side deletes the directory
  // after re-checking. The row's own Delete button already offers that,
  // and a second, wrong route from the menu would be worse than none.
  //
  // The MAIN CHECKOUT is never a removal candidate at all. It is the
  // one row on the page where offering this would be a serious bug
  // rather than a widened gate.
  //
  // PRUNABLE is newly out (#793), and the reason is that the route was
  // simply wrong rather than merely redundant. It used to stay in on the
  // grounds that clearing the stale registration is real work that loses
  // nothing -- true -- but the route it took was
  // `remove_worktree_forced`, which runs `git worktree remove` on a
  // directory that is not there. Wrong verb, and since #798 it now runs
  // that wrong verb with `--force`, which is no better.
  //
  // `git worktree prune` is the right verb and #793 made it reachable:
  // one repository-wide affordance in the header, because prune is
  // repo-wide. So this row is not a dead end -- `instead` below sends
  // the user to the action that exists, which is what the old

              #753 declined this outright, reasoning that a one-click
              button beside a row invites clearing another process's
              claim without reading it. That was right for its evidence
              and the evidence changed: 20 of 44 worktrees on the
              reporting machine are locked, all by one pid that is alive
              only because it is the parent session, and nothing is
              working in any of them. At 45% of the list, withholding
              the remedy does not protect anyone — it leaves a view that
              cannot be used and sends the user to a terminal to do the
              same thing with less information.

              So the care went into the CONFIRMATION rather than into
              refusing: it names the holder, the age, and what is
              underneath. This item only opens it.

              ABOVE removal, and not styled as destructive, because it
              is neither. It deletes nothing and `git worktree lock`
              puts it back — and it is the action that usually helps,
              since 16 of the 18 classifiable locked worktrees measured
              were merged underneath. Painting it red would put a
              reversible action in the same visual class as the one
              unrecoverable action on the page. */}
