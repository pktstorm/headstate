/// Every component that renders an empty state also renders a FAILED one.
///
/// # What this enforces
///
/// A component under `src/components` (or `src/App.tsx`) that reads a
/// query and renders "nothing found" copy must also consult `isError` --
/// or `error`, or a query object's `.isError` -- so that a rejected query
/// does not render as an answer.
///
/// # The finding it would have caught (#846, #854)
///
/// `QueryError`'s own doc comment is the canonical statement of the rule,
/// and it is exact: *"A rejected query left `data` at its `[]` default,
/// and the empty-list copy then told the user 'no pull requests match
/// these filters' -- a confident, wrong answer to a question the app
/// could not actually answer. An error has to look like an error."*
///
/// #846 fixed four surfaces BY HAND -- `ArtifactsPage`, `ClaudeMdPage`,
/// `VenvSection`, `WorktreeSidebar`/`ArtifactSidebar` -- and the fifth
/// and sixth were already in the tree when it shipped:
///
/// - **`RepoPickerSidebar`** consumes `useWorktrees`, the very hook #846
///   fixed `WorktreeSidebar` for, and was missed because it is a second
///   consumer of it. Its copy makes it the worst of the set: "No
///   repositories found in the scanned folders" is a DIAGNOSIS pointing
///   at the user's settings, so a failed scan sent someone to fix a
///   configuration that was never wrong. Its own comment states the rule
///   it broke -- *"'We have not looked yet' and 'we looked and there is
///   nothing' are opposite answers"* -- having been given only two of the
///   three arms.
/// - **`CleanupLog`** could not comply however it was written: the gap
///   was in `useCleanupLog`, which destructured `isError` from `useQuery`
///   and returned only `{ entries, isLoading, run }`. #852 had already
///   visited this component to add the `isLoading` arm for this exact
///   bug class and still left the third out.
///
/// # Why a source scan, and why `import.meta.glob`
///
/// The property is about every surface rather than about one, so a render
/// test per component proves the mechanism and says nothing about the
/// seventh component somebody adds -- which is the defect both times.
///
/// `import.meta.glob` rather than the explicit `?raw` imports the four
/// existing source-scanning tests use (`surfaceGuard.test.ts`,
/// `mirroredConstants.test.ts`, `App.lazy.test.tsx`,
/// `worktrees.test.ts`), because a list of imports is exactly the
/// enumeration that let the fifth and sixth surfaces exist. A glob covers
/// a file nobody remembered to add. It was verified to work under this
/// suite's `vmThreads` pool before being relied on -- that pool runs each
/// file in its own V8 context, so it was not safe to assume.
///
/// # What it cannot see, stated rather than glossed
///
/// - **Whether the error arm is REACHABLE.** With `data = []` the empty
///   branch is reached first, so an error arm placed after it never
///   renders in the case it exists for. That ordering is the heart of
///   #846's fix and this guard cannot check it; the per-component tests
///   and `ClaudeMdPage`'s comment carry it.
/// - **Whether the error arm is any GOOD.** `isError` mentioned and
///   ignored passes.
/// - **A failure a component cannot observe.** Several hooks in
///   `src/api/connection.ts` and `phoneNotify.ts` return a plain value
///   rather than a query object, so their callers have nothing to
///   destructure. Those are listed in `NO_QUERY_OF_ITS_OWN` below.
/// - **An empty state this does not recognise as one.** The detector
///   below matches a small set of copy patterns. A component that phrases
///   emptiness some other way is invisible to it -- the usual limit of a
///   text scan, and the reason the self-checks at the bottom assert that
///   the detector still finds the surfaces we know about.
