/// The account-wide Stats page: "how am I doing, across everything".
///
/// # Why this exists beside the scoped pages (#826, reopened)
///
/// #829 deleted it as "superseded" by the scoped board. It was not, and the
/// reason is a different question rather than a narrower one. A scope page
/// answers "how is THIS organisation / repository / person doing", which
/// requires choosing one first; this answers "how am I doing, across
/// everything" with no selection at all. The zero-click overview became a
/// two-click drill-down, and no issue asked for that.
///
/// The scoped pages are good and unchanged. What was wrong was treating one
/// as a replacement for the other.
///
/// # `All repos` is NOT account-wide, and the gap is measured
///
/// This is the part that makes the removal a correctness problem rather than
/// a taste one. The queries behind this page carry `author:@me` and NO
/// repository qualifier (`github/query.rs:241-258`), which is the only shape
/// that spans every organisation the viewer contributes to, owned or not.
///
/// MEASURED live 2026-09-11, 30-day window ending yesterday, one aliased
/// document at cost 1:
///
/// | Query | Merged PRs |
/// |---|---|
/// | `author:@me` (this page) | **893** |
/// | `author:@me user:pktstorm` (Personal / All repos) | **317** |
/// | `author:@me org:FNX-Labs` | 494 |
/// | `author:@me org:Stohic` | 82 |
///
/// So the nearest scoped equivalent shows **35%** of the viewer's activity,
/// and no single sidebar row covers the other 576 pull requests -- they are
/// in organisations the viewer contributes to without owning, which on this
/// account is most of the work. Presenting the scoped page as a replacement
/// lost two thirds of the number with nothing on screen to say so, which is
/// the exact failure mode this feature's every other rule exists to prevent.
///
/// # Three independent queries, each rendering as IT lands
///
/// The property #829 kept for the scope pages and which applies here
/// unchanged: periods ~1.6s, the daily series ~3.7s, the merged sample
/// ~3.7s. Blocking on the slowest left the fast numbers finished and
/// invisible. Each section keeps its own footprint while loading, so nothing
/// jumps as the later queries arrive.
///
/// # It is a SAMPLE, and says so once
///
/// `useMergedDetail` reads the most recent 100 merged pull requests
/// (`github/query.rs:175-195`), so the insight cards and repo shares are of a
/// fixed recent sample rather than of a window. That caveat governs every
/// figure below it and is stated once at the top rather than on each card --
/// and it is precisely why `RepoTable` takes `sampleSize` here and a `hint`
/// on a scope page: two honest claims about two different populations, which
/// is the reason both pages exist.
