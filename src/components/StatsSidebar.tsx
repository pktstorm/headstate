/// `RepoSidebar`, which PR Stats inherited as a deliberate fall-through in
/// #794. That column listed `repoCounts(prs)` -- repositories where the
/// VIEWER HAS AN OPEN PR -- and `ViewSwitcher`'s doc comment recorded both
/// that the rows were "continuity and a future scope hook, not a live
/// filter" and that it was "worth revisiting if PR Stats is ever scoped per
/// repo, at which point these rows stop being decoration". This is that
/// revisit, and the rows are live now.
///
/// The old list could not express the feature's second audience. It has no
/// organisations and no people in it, so "how is my team doing?" (#823) was
/// unaskable; and being derived from open pull requests, a repository with
/// no current PR was simply absent even though its history is exactly what
/// a lead wants to read. #825 requirement 4: absence of PRs is not absence
/// of repo.
///
/// Nothing here consults local git (#825 requirement 3). No worktree roots,
/// no `git remote` -- where you happen to have cloned something has no
/// bearing on whose statistics you want.
///
/// # Discovery is cheap; measurement waits for a click
///
/// `useStatsTree` runs on mount and costs 2 rate-limit points for the whole
/// hierarchy (measured; see `github::stats::tree`). It fetches NO
/// statistics. Clicking a row writes a scope to the store and that is all
/// this component does -- #826 renders the numbers. That is
/// `hooks.ts:712-717`'s split, and it is why arriving at this view is free
/// while a click is not.
///
/// # A selection is a scope, and a member row is a SUBJECT
///
/// Both axes write through `setStatsScope` in one atomic update. A Members
/// row sets the subject AND keeps the organisation scope, because "this
/// person, in this org" is the question that row asks -- a person's activity
/// is only meaningful somewhere. Every other row clears the subject, so
/// clicking a repository after clicking a colleague is a question about the
/// repository rather than about that colleague inside it.

                hierarchy below it -- and because it is the DEFAULT the page

                headings.

                # Why it is not "All repos" under Personal

                Because that row is a different and much smaller number, and
                the difference is measured. `user:<login>` covers the viewer's
                OWN repositories; this carries no repository qualifier at all,
                which is the only shape that spans organisations the viewer
                contributes to without owning. MEASURED live 2026-09-11 over a
                30-day window: account-wide is **893** merged pull requests
                against **317** for Personal / All repos -- 35%, with the
                other 576 in FNX-Labs (494) and Stohic (82). Two rows,
                because they are two answers.

                Selected by `kind: "all"`, the variant `Filters` has carried
                since #825 ("the widest scope was deliberately clicked") with
                nothing selecting it until now -- so the highlight, the store
                and the page agree without a new axis. `value` is `undefined`
                because `scopeIsLoadable` exempts this kind from needing one:
