/// Rendered only on the mobile build -- `SettingsDialog` guards it
/// behind `IS_MOBILE_BUILD`, and a separate component is what keeps
/// `api/phoneNotify` out of the desktop bundle's import graph. The
/// commands it calls do not exist on the desktop, so rendering this
/// there would mean a query that can only ever reject.
///
/// # Why the copy says "that Mac" rather than nothing
///
/// The companion reaches the desktop through the remote surface, so
/// health data on the phone is the DESKTOP's health. An unqualified
/// "battery problems" row here would read as a setting about the phone's
/// own battery, which is a completely different thing and one the user
/// can already see in their status bar. The notifications themselves
/// carry the paired desktop's name (`notify::health_transitions`); this
/// panel has to match, or the setting and the notification it controls
/// appear to be about different machines.
///
/// # Why the best-effort note is not optional
///
/// iOS decides when to grant a background refresh window, so a new pull
/// request surfaces within the hour rather than instantly. A user who
/// expects instant and gets hourly concludes the feature is broken --
/// so the panel says what it actually promises. This is the honest
/// description of local notifications off `BGTaskScheduler`, and #789
/// accepted that tradeoff deliberately rather than building APNs.
