          Only the content pane scrolls.

          Width: `max-w-lg` was 32rem, chosen when this was one column.
          The topic menu then took 9rem of it and left ~20rem for
          controls, which squeezed every row -- the poll-interval label
          and its select, the cleanup granularity rows. `max-w-3xl`
          gives the content pane roughly the width it had before the
          menu existed.

          Height: the dialog had a max but no fixed height, so it sized
          to whichever topic was showing and jumped on every switch --
          moving the window under the cursor, so the topic just clicked
          could end up somewhere else. `h-[32rem]` holds it still.

          Sizing to the tallest topic would also stop the jumping, but
          pads every short topic with dead space and changes again the
          moment a setting is added. A fixed frame does not. */}

          `max-w-3xl` loses to it above 640px and the dialog would come
          out NARROWER than the 32rem it started at. Verified against

          ~214px of content pane at 390px -- not enough for the `w-40`
          selects or the keyboard-shortcut grid inside it, and the
          pairing panel's fingerprint collapsed to an unreadable column.
