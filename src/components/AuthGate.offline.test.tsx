/// Off the desktop's network, which is where a phone spends most of its
/// life, the companion opened on a BLACK PAGE and then covered itself
/// with a full-screen claim that the desktop was not signed in to
/// GitHub. Neither was true and neither was necessary. See #684.
///
/// The mechanism, traced rather than guessed:
///
/// `get_auth_state` is a `Class::Read` command, and on the mobile build
/// every desktop command is forwarded over `remote_call`. The companion
/// serves exactly ONE read from its stored snapshot while the desktop is
/// away -- `get_cached` (`src-mobile/src/companion.rs`) -- so
/// `get_auth_state` rejects with "<desktop> is unreachable: ...".
///
/// 1. THE BLACK PAGE. `main.tsx` builds a bare `new QueryClient()`, so
///    the auth query carried TanStack's default three retries with
///    exponential backoff: roughly seven seconds of `isLoading`, during
///    which `AuthGate` returned `null`. `PairingGate` had meanwhile
///    dismissed the splash at its 3s floor, because the connection state
///    HAD settled -- on "unreachable". Between the two, the window was a
///    `#0d1117` rectangle with nothing in it, which is what a crash
///    looks like.
///
/// 2. THE ACCUSATION. When the retries finally ran out, `data` was still
///    undefined, `data?.ok` was falsy, and the mobile branch rendered
///    "Your desktop is not signed in to GitHub" over the whole app -- a
///    statement about a machine the phone had never managed to ask.
///
/// The fix is not a better error screen. Being away from the desktop is
/// the ordinary state of a phone, so the app degrades: the cached list
/// renders, `StaleRibbon` marks it as a saved copy, `useWritesPaused`
/// keeps the write actions disabled, and `ConnectionBanner` carries the
/// desktop's status in the one line that already exists for it.
