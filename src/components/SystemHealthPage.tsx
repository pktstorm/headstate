/// describes the MACHINE, so a repo picker beside it would be a control
/// that changes nothing -- see `App.tsx`, which renders no sidebar repo
/// list and no `FilterBar` for it.
///
/// # Whose machine
///
/// On the phone this view describes the PAIRED DESKTOP, never the phone
/// itself. A companion reporting its own battery would be answering a
/// question nobody asked: the user opened it to check on the machine
/// they left running.
///
/// The wording is switched on `IS_MOBILE_BUILD`, not on `useIsMobile()`.
/// Which machine is being described is a fact about the BUILD, and
/// `useIsMobile()` is also true for a narrow desktop window -- where a
/// page headed "the desktop's health" would be describing the very
/// machine it is running on. See the ground rules on #590.
///
/// # Two rules the panels below exist to keep
///
/// 1. **Absent is not zero.** Every optional field on the Rust `Sample`
///    is `null` when the platform does not expose it, and this file
///    renders every one of those as "Not measured". A 0 in that slot
///    would be a measurement the app never took, which is the same
///    class of lie as reporting "no updates" for a check that failed
///    to run.
/// 2. **Gaps are gaps.** The sampler only runs while the app is open,
///    so the series has holes. `splitOnGaps` (in `lib/health`) breaks
///    the line across them rather than joining two points hours apart,
///    because the whole value of a 24-hour chart is being able to trust
///    the shape of the line.
///
/// The pure logic behind both rules lives in `@/lib/health`, so it is
/// testable without rendering; this file is the layout.

/// Nothing measured, said the same way everywhere.
///
/// One component rather than a repeated string so that the phrase, the
/// colour, and the fact that it is NOT a number are decided in one
/// place. Grey, deliberately: an absent reading is not a warning, and
/// amber would tell the user to act on something the app simply did

/// with no history behind them, thermal is a single coarse label, and
/// uptime is one figure. The brief allowed omitting them, and the
/// argument against that is that the sidebar is a list of what this
/// view can tell you about the machine -- and a class silently missing
/// from it is a question the reader assumes the app cannot answer.
///
/// What they share is real rather than convenient: all three describe
/// the machine's CONDITION rather than its work. Battery and thermal
/// are directly coupled -- a hot machine on battery is throttled and
/// draining -- and uptime is the window every other reading on this
/// page is measured within.
///
/// This page adds what the overview panel cannot: the coupling between
/// the three, said once, where all three are on screen.
