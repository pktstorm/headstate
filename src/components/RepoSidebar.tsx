/// always-first "All repositories" entry that is the default (no `repo`
/// filter set). Selecting a repo writes through the shared filter store --
/// this component holds no filter state of its own.
///
/// This is the sidebar for My PRs, and the fall-through for any future
/// view that has no column of its own. Stats used to own a pinned row at
/// the bottom of it, outside the scroll area so it stayed reachable
/// however many repos the list grew to. That row is gone: the destination
/// moved into `ViewSwitcher`, which is where the rest of the app's
/// navigation already lived.
///
/// It also SERVED PR Stats between #794 and #825, with the repo rows live
/// but read by nothing. That is over: #825 gave PR Stats its own
/// `StatsSidebar`, a GitHub-sourced hierarchy of organisations,
/// repositories and members, because a list of repositories where the
/// viewer has an open PR cannot hold an organisation or a person and so
/// could not express "how is my team doing?". The `repoActive` guard below
/// is what is left of the arrangement, and it is still worth keeping --
/// see its comment.

  // (its scope lives in `statsScopeKind` / `statsScopeValue` now).
  //
  // Guarded on `view` at all because this component is the FALLBACK

  // otherwise show a repo row highlighted for a page that never reads
