/// `DialogContent`'s base classes carried the margin as
/// `max-w-[calc(100%-2rem)]`. `cn` is `twMerge`, which treats `max-w-*`
/// as ONE conflict key -- so a caller passing `max-w-lg` did not narrow
/// the dialog within the cap, it removed the cap. All 18 call sites pass
/// one, so every dialog in the app lost it, and at 390px each rendered
/// exactly 390px wide: edge to edge, corners clipped by the screen, and
/// no backdrop strip left at the sides to tap.

/// This asserts the property rather than the string: the fix is that the
/// margin lives on a key the callers do not set, and a future refactor
/// that moves it back onto `max-w-*` should fail here rather than in
