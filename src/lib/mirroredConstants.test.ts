/// The constants that exist twice, once per language, and the assertion
/// that they still agree.
///
/// #850 found five such pairs whose doc comments said the agreement was
/// asserted. None of them read the other side. One -- the artifact
/// active-build window -- had already drifted to a different value in
/// each language while both comments went on claiming they matched, and
/// the drift was user-visible.
///
/// The shape of the failure each pair had is the reason this file exists
/// rather than more per-module tests. A Rust test asserting
/// `GAP_MS == 30 * 60_000` reads one side twice. A TS test asserting
/// `rows.length === TOP_N` reads the constant SYMBOLICALLY, so it passes
/// at any value. Both feel like agreement tests and neither can fail
/// when one side changes, which is the only event they exist to catch.
///
/// So every assertion here pulls the Rust literal out of Rust SOURCE and
/// compares it to the TypeScript value. The direction that matters is
/// that changing EITHER side alone fails: Rust-only changes break the
/// extracted number, TS-only changes break the imported one.
///
/// Two existing idioms do this already and both are deliberate choices
/// over a generated file: `src-mobile/src/surface.rs:250` reads the
/// desktop's table with `include_str!`, and `src/api/surfaceGuard.test.ts`
/// reads Rust source with `?raw`. `?raw` is used here because four of

/// because the spelling is not the invariant: `15 * 60` and `900` are
