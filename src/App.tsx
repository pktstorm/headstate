/// The two heavy views, split off the launch chunk (#838).
///
/// # Measured, before and after
///
/// The frontend shipped as ONE chunk with no dynamic imports at all, so a
/// launch parsed every view before painting the PR list -- on a tray app
/// whose value proposition is a fast badge. With the two routes split:
///
/// | | launch chunk | time to React's first commit |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | before | 1,378,820 B | 33.1 ms median |
/// | after | 945,919 B | 24.8 ms median |
///
/// A 432,901-byte (31%) drop on the launch path and ~8ms off the median,
/// which is about 25%. Headless Chrome, HTTP cache disabled, one browser,
/// three warm-up loads discarded, 21 loads per side interleaved A/B so
/// machine drift hits both equally; a second independent run of the same
/// harness agreed (33.5 / 26.0 mean). FCP did NOT move -- 36ms to 32ms,
/// inside the noise -- and that is expected rather than disappointing:
/// `index.html` paints its own styled shell before any module evaluates,
/// so FCP never saw the bundle. The number that moves is the one a user
/// waits on, which is when the list appears.
///
/// # What is actually in the split chunks
///
/// `recharts` (9.3 MB on disk) now lands in the StatsPage chunk and is
/// absent from the launch chunk -- verified on the build output, not
/// inferred: `grep -c recharts` over the three chunks gives 15 / 0 / 0.
///
/// One correction to #838's own description while I was here. It names
/// four recharts importers; only ONE actually imports it. `ui/chart.tsx`
/// does, and `stats/ActivityChart` imports both it and recharts directly.
/// `stats/Leaderboard` and `SystemHealthPage` only MENTION recharts, in
/// comments explaining why each draws its own SVG instead
/// (`Leaderboard.tsx:59-65`, `SystemHealthPage.tsx:173`). The split is
/// still right -- ActivityChart lives behind the Stats route, which is
/// where the library went -- but the health page's 51 kB chunk is its own
/// code rather than a charting library, and a reader comparing the chunk
/// sizes against the issue would otherwise find them inexplicable.
///
/// # The phone gets more out of this than the desktop
///
/// `pr-stats` is in `MOBILE_HIDDEN_VIEWS` (`store/filters.ts`), so the
/// companion has no way to reach the Stats route at all -- which means the
/// 382 kB StatsPage chunk, recharts included, is never fetched there
/// rather than merely fetched late. Before the split that code was in the
/// one chunk every phone launch parsed, for a view the phone does not
/// ship. System Health is NOT hidden, so its chunk is still reachable on
/// a phone; it is 51 kB and carries no charting library, per the
/// correction above.
///
/// Verified on the mobile build rather than assumed: `VITE_TARGET=mobile
/// yarn build` produces the same three chunks.
///
/// # Why the ROUTE boundary and not the chart components
///
/// `React.lazy` needs a component boundary already gated behind a user
/// action, and these two are: both are reached only by clicking a view.
/// Splitting lower down -- lazying `ActivityChart` inside a synchronously
/// loaded `StatsPage` -- would leave the page's own code on the launch
/// path (381 kB of the 433 kB moved), and would put a Suspense boundary
/// in the middle of a layout that deliberately renders its sections as
/// each query lands (`StatsPage.tsx:12-22`). The route boundary changes
/// no component's internals at all.
///
/// # Why the SIDEBARS are not lazy
///
/// Neither `StatsSidebar` nor `SystemHealthSidebar` imports charting code
/// (verified by grep). Lazying them would add two more Suspense
/// boundaries to move almost nothing, and `SystemHealthSidebar` is
/// imported BY `SystemHealthPage` anyway (`SystemHealthPage.tsx:47` reads
/// `healthPagesFor` from it), so splitting it would only duplicate it.
///
/// # Why not `manualChunks`
///
/// `vite.config.ts` still has no `rollupOptions`, and does not need one:
/// the route boundary is a real boundary in the import graph, so the
/// bundler derives the split from the code. A `manualChunks` function
/// would be a second, hand-maintained description of the same fact, and
/// one that goes stale silently when an import moves. `src/App.lazy.test.tsx`
/// guards the property instead.
///
/// # `lucide-react` tree-shakes; checked, not assumed
///
/// #838 also asked whether lucide's 44 MB on disk reaches the bundle. It
/// does not. The package ships 2,057 icon modules; `src/` imports 52
/// distinct icons, whose own modules contain 109 `<path>` elements between
/// them, and the built chunks hold 118 SVG path literals -- the 109 plus a
/// handful from the app's hand-drawn SVG. If the set had shipped the count
/// would be in the thousands. Nothing to do here, and worth recording so
/// the 44 MB does not get re-investigated.
