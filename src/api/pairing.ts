/// The phone's side of pairing: scanning a desktop's QR, pasting one,
/// and forgetting a desktop again.
///
/// The Rust half of all this shipped with #514 and has been complete
/// since: `pair_from_qr` validates the payload, pins the desktop's
/// certificate, generates the hardware-backed key and stores the
/// pairing; `unpair` forgets it. What was missing was any caller at
/// all -- the commands appeared in `remote.ts`'s `CLIENT_COMMANDS` set
/// and nowhere else, so a freshly installed phone had no way to pair
/// and fell through to the desktop's "install the GitHub CLI" screen.
///
/// Everything here is mobile-only by construction: `pair_from_qr` and
/// `unpair` are the companion's OWN commands, not the desktop's, and
/// the barcode scanner is a mobile plugin. The desktop build must not
/// import this module; `PairingScreen` is what guards that, behind
/// `IS_MOBILE_BUILD`.

/// What the camera can be in, as far as the pairing screen cares.
///
/// `prompt` covers Tauri's `prompt` and `prompt-with-rationale`: both
/// mean "asking will show the system sheet", which is the only
/// distinction the UI needs. `denied` is the one that matters -- on iOS
/// a denied camera can never be re-prompted by the app, so the only way
/// forward is Settings or the paste fallback, and the screen has to say
/// so rather than silently failing to open a camera.
