/// own process, the `git`/`gh`/Docker subprocesses we spawn, and the
/// Docker daemon. #795 removed the panel and those three fields: a
/// once-a-second sample could not catch the bursty `git` fan-out that is
/// our real cost, so it told users we were cheap when we were not
/// measurable this way.
///
/// The COMMAND STRING could not follow. It is matched as a literal in
/// two remote-surface allowlists, one of which ships in the phone app on
/// its own release tag, so renaming it breaks a phone paired with an
/// older desktop. A misnomer with a paragraph beats a wire break.
