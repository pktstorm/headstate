/// The phone's own notification preferences (#789).
///
/// # Why these are not the desktop's `NotifyPrefs`
///
/// The desktop's `get_notify_prefs` is `Class::Local` on the remote
/// surface, so the phone cannot read or write it -- and that
/// classification is correct: which notifications a desktop shows at
/// that desktop is a decision made there.
///
/// It is also the right answer on the merits. The two devices are in
/// different places, and a person may well want CI failures on the
/// laptop they are working at and only new pull requests on the phone in
/// their pocket. One shared setting could not express that, so the phone
/// keeps its own in the companion's store and this module is how the
/// Settings UI reaches them.
///
/// Everything here is mobile-only by construction, the same way
/// `pairing.ts` is: `get_phone_notify_prefs` and `set_phone_notify_prefs`
/// are the companion's OWN commands, absent from the desktop build, and
/// `CLIENT_COMMANDS` in `remote.ts` is what routes them to the companion
/// rather than onto the wire. The desktop build must not import this
/// module; the Settings dialog guards that behind `IS_MOBILE_BUILD`.
///
/// # The delivery tradeoff, which the UI must state
///
/// Notifications are delivered from inside the background refresh window
/// iOS grants, so delivery is BEST-EFFORT: a new pull request surfaces
/// within the hour rather than instantly. That is why the panel carries
/// a sentence saying so -- a user who expects instant and gets hourly
/// concludes the feature is broken rather than that it is working as
/// designed.

/// Mirrors the Rust `notify::PhoneNotifyPrefs`.
///
/// Field names match the desktop's `NotifyPrefs` where the categories
/// match, so the two read as one vocabulary. There is deliberately no
/// `ci_failed` or `conflicted`: those come from the desktop's poll loop
/// and the phone is not the thing polling GitHub.
