// iOS suspends the webview, and a resume fires `visibilitychange` but
// does NOT reliably fire `window.focus` -- which is what TanStack's
// default `refetchOnWindowFocus` waits for. So on the one platform where
// suspension is guaranteed, the focus-based refetch that keeps the
// desktop current was unreliable: the `prs` list recovered (the
// companion replays a snapshot frame on resubscribe) but everything
// pulled rather than pushed did not. Leave a PR detail view, background
// the app for an hour, come back: hour-old checks and review threads,
// with nothing to say so.
//
// Driving `focusManager` rather than calling `invalidateQueries` keeps
// each query's own `staleTime` in charge -- a blanket invalidate would
// refetch things that are deliberately cached forever. Registered for
// both builds: on the desktop `visibilitychange` fires when the window
// is minimised or hidden, which is a moment worth refetching on there
// too, and the desktop's existing focus behaviour is unchanged.
