//! `tauri-plugin-headstate-notify`: the phone's LOCAL user
//! notifications (#789).
//!
//! `UNUserNotificationCenter`, posted from inside the background refresh
//! window `tauri-plugin-headstate-refresh` is granted. That is the
//! entire mechanism, and #789's scope comment settles it: **no APNs, no
//! certificates, no push server.**
//!
//! # The tradeoff, stated rather than buried
//!
//! Delivery is BEST-EFFORT. iOS decides when to grant a background
//! refresh window -- opportunistically, at most every fifteen minutes
//! or so, and never for an app the user has force-quit -- so a new pull
//! request surfaces "within the hour", not instantly. That is the honest
//! description of this feature and it belongs in the UI copy as well as
//! here.
//!
//! The alternative was APNs push from the desktop, which is timely and
//! much more work: credentials, a push path from a desktop on a
//! Tailscale-style link rather than a public server, and per-device
//! targeting built on the pairing identity. #789 keeps it as a possible
//! follow-up if an hour proves too slow in practice. It is not a thing
//! this plugin can grow into incrementally -- it is a different
//! delivery path -- which is why the scope decision was made before any
//! code.
//!
//! # Why this is a separate plugin from `headstate-refresh`
//!
//! The refresh plugin owns an OS SCHEDULER and a channel Rust is called
//! back on. This one owns a post-and-return API with a permission gate.
//! Folding them together would put a user-facing permission prompt
//! inside the lifecycle object that registers background tasks before
//! `UIApplicationMain`, and the ask-once discipline below is precisely
//! about WHEN the prompt appears.
//!
//! It also keeps `scripts/check-plugin-commands.py` satisfied for free:
//! the refresh plugin has Kotlin, so every name in its `mod cmd` must
//! have a matching `@Command`. This plugin is iOS-only and has no
//! `android/` directory, so the check skips it -- see `build.rs` on why
//! Android is absent by decision rather than by omission.
//!
//! # Ask ONCE, before the first use
//!
//! [`HeadstateNotify::allowed`] mirrors the desktop's
//! `poll::notification_allowed`: read the state, and only if it is
//! undetermined ask for it -- then remember the answer for the process.
//! Prompting at launch was rejected there and is rejected here for the
//! same reason. On a phone it is worse: the first launch of a companion
//! app is the pairing flow, a QR scan the user is in the middle of, and
//! a permission sheet in front of it is a sheet dismissed without being
//! read. A denial is then permanent and silent.
//!
//! So the prompt appears the first time the app has something to say.
//! A user who sees "Allow notifications?" immediately after a pull
//! request appeared has the context to answer it.
//!
//! # Notification TAPS are deliberately not handled
//!
//! Tapping a notification opens the app, which is the whole of what a
//! user expects. Routing a tap to a specific pull request needs a
//! `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` set before the app finishes
//! launching, a payload convention, and a frontend route to navigate
//! to -- and it is a navigation feature, not a notification one. Left
//! out so the first release of this is small enough to be obviously
//! correct.
