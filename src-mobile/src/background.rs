//! What the phone does when it is in the background: a single refresh
//! per OS-granted window, and nothing else.
//!
//! The spec's decision ("What the phone does when it is in the
//! background") is that the phone does nothing while suspended and
//! catches up on resume, which is the event subscriber's reconnect
//! (`subscribe_events`, `companion.rs`) and is not duplicated here. The
//! one cheap improvement it allows is [`BackgroundRefresh`]: when
//! `tauri-plugin-headstate-refresh` is granted a window, `GET /v1/hello`
//! and then the cached list, exactly what a connect does before the
//! stream, store the list as the snapshot, and return. On any error give
//! up quietly; nothing retries inside the window.
//!
//! **Never `/v1/events`.** The snapshot the subscriber gets is the first
//! frame of the stream; the background path must not open the stream,
//! so it asks for the same list through `get_cached` instead (the
//! desktop's `remote/events.rs` documents them as the same data). The
//! [`Desktop`] seam has no way to open the stream at all, and the tests
//! pin the request sequence -- against the fake, and against the
//! loopback server with the real client.
//!
//! [`Desktop`] and [`SnapshotSink`] are implemented by [`Companion`]:
//! `hello` is `Client::hello`, `get_cached` is
//! `Client::call("get_cached", {}, None)` on the live client, `save` is
//! `events::save_snapshot` plus `Connection::mark_poll`. A window does
//! not move the connection state: the subscriber owns that, and a
//! desktop that is away is the expected case for a phone in a pocket.
//!
//! # The notification pass (#789)
//!
//! A window now does one more thing, AFTER the snapshot is stored: it
//! compares the list it just fetched against what the last pass saw and
//! posts a local notification for anything that appeared, then asks the
//! desktop for its health conditions and posts the transitions. This is
//! the entire delivery path for #789 -- local notifications off the back
//! of the window iOS grants -- and its cost is that delivery is
//! BEST-EFFORT: a new pull request surfaces within the hour rather than
//! instantly.
//!
//! Three rules it follows, each the subject of a test below:
//!
//! 1. **The snapshot is stored first, and a notification failure never
//!    fails the window.** The snapshot is the thing the app opens with;
//!    notifications are an affordance. Ordering them the other way would
//!    let a denied permission cost the user a fresh list.
//! 2. **A third request, not a wider seam.** `health_alerts` is added to
//!    [`Desktop`] deliberately, and `the_seam_offers_only_what_a_window_needs`
//!    is updated with it rather than relaxed -- the seam's job is to make
//!    "this path cannot open the stream" structural, and it still has no
//!    method that could.
//! 3. **Health is asked for only when it would be used.** A phone whose
//!    health categories are all off makes two requests, not three. A
//!    background window is a few seconds of granted time and a request
//!    whose answer is discarded spends some of it.
