//! The constants this crate shares with the desktop, asserted against the
//! desktop's own source.
//!
//! # Why this file exists (#854)
//!
//! #850 found five constants whose doc comments said the agreement with
//! their other copy was asserted, and which no test actually checked. One
//! had already drifted -- `15 * 60` in Rust against `60 * 60` in the UI,
//! both comments claiming they matched -- with three user-visible
//! consequences. `src/lib/mirroredConstants.test.ts` is the remedy, and
//! it covers exactly those five pairs, every one of which has its second
//! copy in TypeScript.
//!
//! The Rust-to-Rust pairs were never in scope of that file, and
//! `invariants::tests::every_cross_crate_constant_is_read_from_both_sides`
//! in the desktop crate found eleven of them. This is their assertion.
//!
//! Worst of the eleven, and the reason this is a file rather than a
//! footnote: `ECDSA_SIG_LEN` and `MLDSA_SIG_LEN` live in
//! `crates/headstate-stepup`, whose module doc says in so many words that
//! it holds what "both ends must agree on" -- and `keys.rs` DECLARES THEM
//! AGAIN instead of importing them. `keys.rs` then asserts its own local
//! copies against literals, so a change in the shared crate is invisible
//! here. These are signature lengths on a signing boundary: disagree on
//! one and every step-up signature this phone makes is rejected by a
//! desktop that cannot say why, or -- worse, for the ML-DSA length --
//! a truncated signature is verified against a padded buffer.
//!
//! # The mechanism, and why it is source text
//!
//! `include_str!` on the desktop's and the shared crate's sources, the
//! idiom `surface.rs:248` already uses here for the command table, with
//! the reason it gives: it "ties this test to the desktop file at compile
//! time, so the two are compared as they are checked in, not as someone
//! remembers them." A `cargo` dependency cannot do it -- `src-mobile` is
//! a separate crate with its own lockfile and does not depend on
//! `src-tauri` at all, which is exactly why these values were copied.
//!
//! The DIRECTION that matters is that changing either side alone fails:
//! the extracted number moves when the desktop moves, and the compared
//! constant moves when this crate does. An assertion against a literal --
//! `assert_eq!(NONCE_LEN, 16)`, which `src-tauri/src/remote/stepup.rs`
//! still does -- reads one side twice and cannot fail when the other
//! moves. That is the anti-pattern `mirroredConstants.test.ts`' header
//! was written to condemn and this file avoids.
//!
//! # What this cannot see
//!
//! - **A pair with a different name on each side.** The desktop's
//!   `SEED_LEN` (32) and this crate's `VAULT_KEY_LEN` (32) are the same
//!   32 bytes, and nothing here or in the guard relates them.
//! - **A value copied as a bare literal** rather than as a named
//!   constant. `listener::PORT` is `41919` on the desktop and an unnamed
//!   `41919` in five places in this crate; only the named side is visible
//!   to the guard that demanded this file.
//! - **Whether the two values MEAN the same thing.** That judgement is
//!   the `COINCIDENTAL` list in the desktop's guard, and it is made by
//!   reading both, once, deliberately.
