//! The HTTPS client for the paired desktop: reqwest on rustls with the
//! aws-lc-rs provider (which carries ML-DSA as of 0.23.44), the ML-DSA-65
//! session certificate as the client identity, and a server verifier
//! that accepts one certificate -- the one whose SHA256 fingerprint was
//! pinned at pairing -- signed with ML-DSA-65 and nothing else.
//!
//! - TLS 1.3 only, X25519MLKEM768 offered first (the same provider and
//!   order as the desktop's listener). The provider is the one that can
//!   sign CertificateVerify with the ML-DSA-65 session key and verify
//!   the desktop's; the plain aws-lc-rs provider cannot load the key
//!   at all. See Cargo.toml for what its `aws-lc-rs-unstable` feature
//!   does and does not mean.
//! - No hostname check and no chain: the desktop's certificate is
//!   self-signed and names no host, because a laptop's address changes
//!   with every network. The fingerprint IS the identity; the handshake
//!   signature proves the peer holds its key.
//! - The desktop may be reachable at several addresses (LAN, overlay);
//!   [`Client`] tries them in order with a short connect timeout each
//!   and remembers the one that answered.
//!
//! # Errors the caller acts on
//!
//! [`ClientError::Handshake`] is the one that matters: TLS refused the
//! connection. Before pairing that means the QR's fingerprint does not
//! match what the server presented. After pairing it means the desktop
//! refused OUR certificate, which is what revocation looks like from
//! here -- the spec's "the phone learns it is revoked on its next
//! handshake failure". Everything network-shaped is
//! [`ClientError::Unreachable`], which the next address, or the next
//! retry, may fix.
