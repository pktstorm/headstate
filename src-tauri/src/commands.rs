/// The first command on the hardened stats layer, and deliberately the

/// protections end to end -- parameterised subject and scope,
/// connection-first routing, probe-driven slicing, bounded read
/// concurrency, a wall-clock ceiling, metered spend, an honest
/// partiality report, and the persistence cache.
///
/// No UI calls this yet. #825 builds the sidebar that chooses a scope and
/// #826 the views that render leaderboards; shipping the command now is
/// what makes the layer reachable and testable rather than dead code
/// waiting on two other PRs.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// `subject` is a login, or `None` for the viewer -- NOT for "everyone".
/// A leaderboard's "everyone" is a different question and is
/// `StatsQuery`'s `None` subject; exposing that through this command would
/// make one parameter mean two things, so #826 gets its own command for it
/// rather than an overloaded flag here.
///
/// `scope_kind` is one of `repo`, `org`, `user`, `all`, with `scope_value`
/// carrying `owner/name` or the org/user login. Strings rather than a
/// tagged enum because this is the Tauri boundary: the phone's
/// `remote_call` passes JSON, and `surface::Args` reads scalars.
///
/// # Why the window is clamped
///
/// `clamp_days` exists for exactly this reason on `get_history`
/// (`commands.rs:37-46`): a Tauri command is a public surface, and an
/// unbounded value builds an arbitrarily large plan. Here the blast
/// radius is worse than a long query -- a 100-year window is probed,
/// subdivided, and probed again. The same clamp applies, and the slicer's
/// own `MAX_DEPTH` is the second line of defence.

/// the floor the date grammar imposes -- GitHub has no sub-day range -- and
/// it is reached by any scope busy enough to exceed a 50-node page every day.
///
/// So the bound is computed from the two fan-outs rather than guessed:
///
/// - **Probes.** One request per `query::ALIAS_CHUNK` slices per round, and
///   at most `MAX_PROBE_ROUNDS` rounds before every slice is a single day.
/// - **Detail.** One request per `board::BOARD_ALIAS_CHUNK` slices.
