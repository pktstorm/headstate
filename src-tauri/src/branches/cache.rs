//! A per-repository cache for `scan`, keyed on the refs themselves.
//!
//! # Why a cache at all
//!
//! `scan` costs about 64ms per branch: a `merge-base`, a full `diff`,
//! and a `patch-id` for every branch the cheap checks did not settle.
//! Measured on a 64-branch repository that is 4.1s serial, and the
//! parallel scan lands at 10-13s on a 512-branch, 1784-commit one.
//!
//! `useBranches` sets a deliberately short `staleTime` of 10s, because
//! this page's answer decides whether a branch is safe to DELETE and a
//! stale "yes" is the expensive mistake. That reasoning is right and
//! this cache does not weaken it: the page still refetches, and this
//! layer simply makes the refetch cheap when nothing has changed.
//!
//! # Why the key is the refs
//!
//! A time-based cache would be exactly the wrong shape here -- it would
//! answer "recently" when the question is "still true". Every input to
//! a branch's classification is a ref: its own tip, the default
//! branch's tip, and which branches exist at all. If none of those
//! moved, no answer can have changed. If any moved, the entry is
//! dropped rather than aged.
//!
//! Building the key is one `for-each-ref` over `refs/heads` and
//! `refs/remotes` -- 476ms on the repository measured above, against
//! ~10s for the scan it avoids. It is deliberately the WHOLE ref state
//! and not a cheaper summary like a count: a force-push moves a tip
//! without changing how many refs exist, and a count would call that
//! unchanged.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not cached
//!
//! Nothing is persisted to disk. A stale entry surviving a restart
//! would be a "safe to delete" computed against a repository that has
//! since moved on, and the value of skipping one scan does not justify
//! carrying that risk across process boundaries.

/// refs-only key calls that state unchanged and would serve a
/// `Merged` verdict for a branch that is now checked out.
///
/// The listing would then offer a deletion git cannot perform. Not
/// destructive, since the delete re-checks against an uncached scan
/// and fails, but a view that offers actions which then fail is the
