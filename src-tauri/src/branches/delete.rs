//! Deleting branches, local and remote.
//!
//! The contract `remove_worktree` established, kept here: the safety
//! gate is RE-EVALUATED at delete time. What the UI last saw may be
//! minutes old and a branch can be merged, checked out, or advanced in
//! between -- so the list the user ticked is a list of names, never a
//! list of permissions.
//!
//! # Two phases, reported separately (#724)
//!
//! A deletion is a re-check and then a deletion, and the re-check is
//! the slow half: it is a full uncached [`scan::scan`] of the
//! repository, ~64ms per branch, so 562 selected branches spent
//! MINUTES in the gate before the first ref was touched. Reported as
//! one counter, that reads as broken -- the number would sit at 0/562
//! through the longest part of the wait, which is exactly the "ten
//! minutes with no progress" this module was reported for.
//!
//! So [`DeleteProgress`] has a call per phase. `checking` counts
//! branches classified by the re-check scan; `deleted` counts refs
//! actually removed, and carries the failures so far, because a batch
//! where thirty branches were refused must say so while it runs rather
//! than in a burst of toasts at the end.
