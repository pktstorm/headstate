/// 30s, not lower: measured per-POST latency on a reported six-day

/// better than waiting out a request that has already missed its window.
///
/// The measured floor is `mergeStateStatus`, which GitHub computes per

///
/// # Why a shared deadline rather than halving `FETCH_TIMEOUT`
///
/// #844 offers both. Halving does not survive the OTHER guard:

/// node-heavy queries, so issuing both at once makes the slow one slower
/// by more than the overlap saves. `fetch_prs_and_reviewing`
/// (`client.rs:564`) does run two searches concurrently, and its own
/// diagnostic comment is about exactly this: a total far above the slower
/// of the two means they are not actually overlapping.
