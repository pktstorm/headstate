//! Rules this codebase already states, asserted over its own source.
//!
//! # Why this module exists (#854)
//!
//! Six parallel audits of v5.13.0 produced about fifty findings, and the
//! thing every auditor noticed independently was that almost none was a
//! conceptual gap. The security auditor put it best: *"In every case the
//! correct implementation already exists elsewhere in this same codebase,
//! usually with a doc comment explaining the threat. None of these are
//! conceptual gaps in the authors' understanding; they are places a known
//! rule was not propagated to a sibling."*
//!
//! Fifty patches fix fifty instances and prevent none. The rule was
//! known every time -- written down, often measured -- and it still did
//! not reach the sibling, so the fifty-first arrives next release. What
//! closes that is a test that fails the moment the sibling is written.
//!
//! # Why the checks here are source scans
//!
//! Each property below is a statement about EVERY call site rather than
//! about observable behaviour at one of them. A behavioural test proves
//! the mechanism works -- which is rarely the thing in doubt -- while
//! saying nothing about the next call site somebody adds. That argument
//! is not new here: `stats::fetch`'s
//! `every_stats_read_goes_through_the_process_wide_permit` makes it at
//! length, and `stats::budget`'s `every_stats_query_meters_itself` is the
//! model this module follows throughout.
//!
//! # Derived, not enumerated
//!
//! The one hard lesson of #844, #842 and #847 is that a hand-written list
//! cannot cover the item nobody remembered to add to it -- all three
//! defects were exactly that, and #844's metering guard found two
//! uncovered documents the moment it stopped naming six. So every scan
//! here DISCOVERS its subjects:
//!
//! - the files, by walking the crate tree at runtime rather than by
//!   `include_str!` on a fixed list, so a brand-new file is covered
//!   without anyone remembering to add it. `include_str!` is the existing
//!   idiom and it is the one thing it cannot do: `every_query_document`
//!   names two paths, which is why `stats/tree.rs`' two documents sit
//!   outside it to this day.
//! - the call sites, by scanning that text.
//!
//! # What a source scan cannot see, stated rather than glossed
//!
//! These limits are real and shared by every check below:
//!
//! - **It cannot follow a call.** A check performed in a helper is
//!   invisible, so where a guard would otherwise report a defect at a
//!   location that does not have one, it offers a NAMED exemption with a
//!   recorded reason rather than a loose pattern.
//! - **It reads text, not semantics.** `"remove_dir_all"` inside a string
//!   literal or a doc comment looks like a call. Comment lines are
//!   skipped explicitly for that reason.
//! - **It sees only this crate tree.** A removal performed by a
//!   dependency, or through `std::process::Command`, is outside every
//!   check here.
//! - **It cannot prove a check is CORRECT**, only that one is present.
//!   `symlink_metadata` called and its answer ignored would pass. The
//!   behavioural tests beside each gate are what cover that, and they
//!   are cited from the checks that depend on them.
//!
//! A guard that cries wolf gets disabled -- `check-privacy.sh:120`
//! records ~40 false positives from one unanchored pattern as the reason
//! every pattern in it is anchored. So each check here prefers an
//! explicit, commented allowlist over a broader regex, and every entry in
//! one says why it is there.

    // ---- Invariant 2: refs reaching a git argv ---------------------------

    /// Every reader of `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` validates what it got.
    ///
    /// # What it enforces
    ///
    /// A production function that asks git for `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`
    /// must pass the answer through `is_safe_ref` before returning it.
    ///
    /// # Why this shape, and not the one #854 asked for
    ///
    /// #854 states the invariant as "every ref or name reaching a
    /// `git`/`docker` argv is behind a flag-shape validator or a `--`".
    /// That was written as a PER-SINK rule, and this codebase deliberately
    /// rejected the per-sink form. `is_safe_ref`'s own doc comment says
    /// so: validation is done "at the BOUNDARIES where remote-controlled
    /// refs enter ... rather than at each of the ten call sites, because a
    /// boundary cannot be forgotten. The `--` separators at the sinks are
    /// the second layer, not the only one."
    ///
    /// A guard demanding a validator or a `--` at each of roughly forty
    /// `git` spawn sites would therefore report the architecture as the
    /// defect. It would fire on `merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD <default>`,
    /// which is correct by construction -- the ref was validated at its
    /// boundary and git's own `merge-base` takes no `--` -- and on
    /// `config --get branch.<b>.remote`, where the name is embedded in a
    /// prefix and cannot be read as a flag at all. Dozens of findings,
    /// none of them real. That is the unanchored-pattern mistake
    /// `check-privacy.sh:120` records forty false positives from, and a
    /// gate that cries wolf is a gate someone disables.
    ///
    /// So the invariant is asserted where the codebase actually places it:
    /// at the boundary. The property "a remote-controlled ref is validated
    /// as it enters" is the one that makes every downstream sink safe, and
    /// it is checkable precisely because the boundaries are few and
    /// identifiable by the ref they read.
    ///
    /// # The finding it catches (#854)
    ///
    /// FOUR functions named `default_branch` read
    /// `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, and before #854 exactly ONE validated
    /// it -- `worktrees::scan::default_branch`, which carries the
    /// reasoning in its own comment: *"`origin/HEAD` is written by the
    /// remote, so the short name it yields is validated BEFORE the
    /// `origin/` prefix is put back on. Prefixing first would hide
    /// `--output=EVIL` behind a name that no longer starts with `-`."*
    ///
    /// `branches::scan`, `packages::apply` and `docker::classify` each
    /// grew their own and returned the name unvalidated. It then reached
    /// `rev-list <default>`, `merge-base <branch> <default>` and
    /// `merge-base --is-ancestor <tag> <default>` as a bare argv element
    /// with no `--`, where `--output=/path` is an arbitrary file write
    /// with the app's privileges.
    ///
    /// The reach of the validator was the mechanism of the failure:
    /// `is_safe_ref` was `pub(super)`, so the other three modules could
    /// not call it even had they wanted to. A shared rule only one module
    /// can see is a rule with one user.
    ///
    /// # What it cannot see
    ///
    /// - **Every other remote-controlled value.** This asserts ONE
    ///   boundary, the one with four implementations and three defects.
    ///   `parse_porcelain`'s branch names are the other, guarded and
    ///   tested since it was written. A tag read from a docker image
    ///   label (`docker::origin`) is a third, gated by `looks_like_sha`
    ///   instead -- a stricter check, not a missing one.
    /// - **Whether the validation is correctly ORDERED** -- only that it
    ///   is ordered at all. `symbolic-ref --short` returns
    ///   `origin/<name>`, so `is_safe_ref` on the PREFIXED string is
    ///   worthless: `origin/--output=/tmp/x` begins with `o`. This is not
    ///   hypothetical. Two of the three fixes #854 wrote made exactly that
    ///   mistake, and this guard passed on both -- it was the behavioural
    ///   test `a_flag_shaped_remote_head_is_refused` that caught them. So
    ///   the assertion below also requires a prefix strip in the same
    ///   function, which narrows the hole without closing it: a strip of
    ///   the wrong prefix, or of the right one applied to the wrong value,
    ///   still passes. The per-site behavioural tests are what cover that,
    ///   and they are named here so the pairing is not accidental.
    /// - **The sinks themselves.** A new `git` call passing an
    ///   unvalidated ref from somewhere else entirely is outside this.
    ///   That is the per-sink question, and it is the one judged
    ///   unenforceable above.

    /// t.elapsed();` shape -- a stopwatch around the thing under test.
    ///
    /// # The finding it would have caught (#861)
    ///
    /// `worktrees::scan`'s `worktrees_are_classified_concurrently` carried,
    /// and still carries, this sentence: *"Asserts overlap rather than
    /// wall-clock time: a timing threshold on CI hardware is a flake
    /// generator."* Its only assertion was `whole * 2 < serial_floor`,
    /// where `whole` was a stopwatch around `classify_repo_streaming` --
    /// a wall-clock threshold, four lines under the sentence denying it.
    ///

    /// failure had MEASURED 1.8x overlap: concurrency was working and the
    /// test rejected it anyway, which is the tell that the assertion was
    /// not merely fragile but measuring the wrong thing.
    ///
    /// The doc even named a correct model one module up --
    /// `sizing::paths_are_walked_concurrently`, which asserts `peak > 1` on
    /// a counter of simultaneously-executing workers and carries no
    /// duration at all. So the rule was written down, a working example sat

    /// This is the whole difficulty of this guard and the reason it is

    ///   `classify_repo_streaming` and `.elapsed()` after it -- total
    ///   runtime, which a loaded CI runner inflates without the code
    ///   changing.
    /// - **after**: `closest` is `arrivals.windows(2).map(|w| w[1] - w[0])
    ///   .min()` -- the gap between two OBSERVATIONS made during the run.
    ///   Two reports cannot land closer together than the work producing
    ///   them unless that work overlapped, whatever the machine's speed.
    ///
    /// `solo` is a stopwatch too, and it stays: it is the right-hand side,
    /// the yardstick measured moments earlier on the same machine, so a
    /// slow runner moves both sides of the comparison equally. That is
    /// precisely the property the old form lacked, and it is why the check
    /// below is about the MULTIPLIED operand rather than about either
    /// operand appearing anywhere in the expression.
    ///
    /// # What it cannot see
    ///
    /// - **A test that makes the promise without the words.** The trigger
    ///   is three phrases, chosen because they are the ones this codebase
    ///   actually writes rather than an attempt to understand prose. A doc
    ///   promising overlap in other words is outside this, and #869's guard
    ///   3 -- a general prohibition-vs-body check -- is the stretch goal
    ///   that would cover it. It is deliberately NOT implemented here: #869
    ///   recommends evaluating it separately because it is likely noisy,
    ///   and this repository has already paid for one guard that cried
    ///   wolf.
    /// - **The three phrases do not all mean "disclaims".** Six tests match
    ///   today and only two are disclaimers; `health/footprint.rs` and
    ///   `health/collect.rs` write "wall-clock" to ADMIT a budget they
    ///   assert on deliberately and gate for that reason (#853). The scan
    ///   therefore cannot use the trigger alone to decide anything -- it
    ///   selects a population, and the stopwatch-multiple rule below is
    ///   what separates the defect from the four tests that are correct.
    ///   A guard keyed on "matched the phrase and compares durations" would
    ///   report both gated measurements as defects on its first run.
    /// - **A wall-clock assertion in a test that promises nothing.**
    ///   `src-mobile`'s connect-timeout tests assert on elapsed time on
    ///   purpose and say so. This guard is a consistency check between a
    ///   test's prose and its body, not a ban on timing assertions -- the
    ///   defect class #869 collects is the contradiction, not the timing.
    /// - **A stopwatch laundered through a helper.** `let t = start();` and

        //   which a rule phrased as "no duration comparison" would get
        //   wrong in both cases.
        // - `packages/tools.rs::a_missing_tool_is_not_looked_up_twice` --
