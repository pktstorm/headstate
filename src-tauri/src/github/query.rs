        # repeat the experiment.

        # It is genuinely slow: GitHub computes it per pull request
        # synchronously. MEASURED live against this query's own shape,
        # `first: 25`, marginal cost over an `id`-only search:
        #
        #   5 items  ~ +0.26s     10 items ~ +0.9s     25 items ~ +3.1s
        #
        # -- roughly 50-125ms per item, matching the ~154ms recorded on
        # `client.rs` when PAGE_SIZE was set.
        #
        # WHY DEFERRING IT DOES NOT WORK. The cost is per ITEM, not per
        # request, so a second query that fetches only `id` and
        # `mergeStateStatus` for the same 25 pull requests still measured
        # ~4.8-7.4s against a ~2.2-3.5s baseline. Deferral relocates the
        # spend, it does not remove it, and it adds a rate-limit point
        # and a second list to keep in step with the paging race.
        #
        # Splitting the query in two and issuing both concurrently DOES
        # cut wall time (median 8.6s -> 6.6s, 6 of 6 runs), but the
        # deferred half sets a ~6.4s floor of its own, so time-to-paint

        # is inside the run-to-run variance.
        #
        # WHY IT IS NOT WORTH THAT 1.3s. `unknown` is ALREADY a meaningful
        # value on this field: GitHub returns it while recomputing after
        # an approval, and `hooks.ts` polls every 3s precisely on that
        # state (#699). A deferred fetch would make "not requested yet"
        # indistinguishable from "GitHub is recomputing", turning that
        # poller into a permanent spin and reintroducing the exact staleness
        # bug #699 fixed. The consumers all fail safe on `unknown` -- merge
        # is refused, chips and actions are withheld -- so nothing would be
        # UNSAFE, but every row would flicker its merge chip in after paint
        # on every poll, and the merge button would be withheld for a
        # second on pull requests that can in fact merge.
        #
