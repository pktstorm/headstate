//! WHO and WHERE a stats question is about.
//!
//! Every stats query in `query.rs` is hardcoded `author:@me` -- see
//! `STATS_QUERY` (`query.rs:155-159`), `history_query_range`
//! (`:232-246`), `periods_query` (`:280-297`) and `cycle_trend_query`
//! (`:331-346`). That was right while the page answered exactly one
//! question ("how am I doing?"), and it is the single thing blocking the
//! second audience #823 names ("how is my team doing?"): there is no way
//! to ask about anyone else.
//!
//! This module is that parameter, and nothing more. No UI, no sidebar --
//! #825 builds the hierarchy that chooses a [`Scope`], #826 the views
//! that render the answers. What lands here is the part both need and
//! neither should reinvent: one place that turns a subject and a scope
//! into a GitHub search qualifier string, tested against the real
//! qualifier grammar.
//!
//! # Why a type and not a format string
//!
//! The qualifier is assembled in exactly one function, [`Scope::qualifier`],
//! because a stats answer is only comparable across slices if every slice
//! asked the same question. The adaptive slicer in `slice.rs` issues
//! dozens of searches per load and sums their counts; a subject spelled
//! `author:x` in one slice and `involves:x` in another would produce a
//! total that is not a count of anything. A string built per call site is
//! exactly how that drift happens, so there are no per-call-site strings.
