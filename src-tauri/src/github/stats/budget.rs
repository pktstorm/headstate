//! What a scope load COST, accumulated and actually read.
//!
//! The app has always asked GitHub what its requests cost. `PRS_QUERY`,
//! `MERGED_DETAIL_QUERY` and `COUNT_QUERY` all select
//! `rateLimit { cost remaining resetAt }`, and three of the four stats
//! queries do not select it at all -- but the deeper problem is that
//! NOTHING READ `cost`, anywhere, on any query. The one consumer is
//! `client.rs:906-912`, which reads `remaining` and logs a warning below
//! 500. So the app could tell you it was nearly out of budget, and never
//! what had spent it.
//!
//! That is survivable for a poll loop whose spend is a known constant --
//! `poll.rs:1503-1580` pins `PRS_QUERY`'s cost in a CI test precisely so
//! it stays knowable without being measured at runtime. It is not
//! survivable for this feature, where one sidebar click issues a number
//! of requests that depends on how much activity the scope contains. The
//! probe-driven slicer in `slice.rs` cannot be costed in advance by
//! construction: how many slices it takes IS the thing it discovers.
//!
//! # Why an accumulator and not a log line
//!
//! The unit that matters to a user is the CLICK, not the request. "That
//! org cost you 23 points" is actionable; twenty-three separate log lines
//! each saying "cost 1" are not, and at the fan-out this feature
//! reaches they are noise that buries the one line that mattered.
//!
//! So [`Budget`] is handed to a load, threaded through every request it
//! makes, and read once at the end. `remaining` and `reset_at` are kept
//! as the LOWEST and LATEST seen rather than the last: requests run
//! concurrently (see `fetch.rs`), so "the last response to arrive" is a
//! race, and the pessimistic value is the one a refusal should be based
//! on.
//!
//! # On the cost model
//!
//! Read `poll.rs:1503-1580` before adding a field to any stats query. The
//! short version, which that test learned the hard way: cost is driven by
//! NESTED CONNECTIONS, not by the number of searches, and a connection
//! nested inside another is INVISIBLE to a substring count of its parent
//! -- adding `contexts(` inside `statusCheckRollup` took the live cost
//! from 3 to 4 while the guard's count did not move.
//!
//! For this feature specifically: `additions`, `deletions` and
//! `changedFiles` are scalars and cost nothing extra. This module said
//! `reviews { totalCount }` was "a CONNECTION and priced per search" and
//! that a leaderboard adding it "is not free". **Both halves are wrong**,
//! corrected by measurement for #826 -- and correcting them here rather
//! than only where the new code lives, because a wrong fact left in a
//! module doc is the one a future reader finds first.
//!
//! What GitHub prices is the `first:` ARGUMENT, not the connection.
//! MEASURED live 2026-09-11 on the real detail document:
//! `reviews { totalCount }` costs 1 point at 3, 6 and 15 searches, exactly
//! tracking a scalars-only control, while `reviews(first: 1) { totalCount }`
//! costs 2 from 6 searches up. `labels` behaves identically both ways. So a
//! reviewer leaderboard IS free, and `board.rs`'s module docs carry the
//! full table.
//!
//! This narrows `poll.rs:1503-1580` rather than contradicting it: every
//! connection on that test's cost list is a paged one, so its figures were
//! right about the query it measured. The rule to apply before adding a
//! field here is therefore "does it take `first:`", and `MEASURED_*` below
//! records what was measured rather than what was assumed.
