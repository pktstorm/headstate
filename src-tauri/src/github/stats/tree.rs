//! The scope tree: which organisations, repositories and people a stats
//! question can be asked ABOUT, enumerated from GitHub.
//!
//! #825's half of the feature. `scope.rs` answers "how do I spell a
//! question about this scope"; this module answers the question that comes
//! first and had no answer at all: **what scopes exist?** Before this,
//! nothing in the app enumerated an organisation or a person -- #823
//! recorded zero hits for `organization`, `membersWithRole` and
//! `viewer.organizations`, and the only identity query in the codebase was
//! `{ viewer { login } }`.
//!
//! # What it replaces, and why that had to go
//!
//! The PR Stats sidebar listed `repoCounts(prs)` (`src/lib/repos.ts`):
//! repositories where the VIEWER HAS AN OPEN PR. That list cannot express
//! the question the feature is for. It has no organisations and no people
//! in it, so "how is my team doing?" is unaskable; and it is derived from
//! open pull requests, so a repository with no current PR activity is
//! absent even though its history is exactly what a lead wants to read.
//! #825 requirement 4, stated as a rule: **absence of PRs is not absence
//! of repo.**
//!
//! It is also local-git-free by construction (#825 requirement 3). No
//! worktree root, no `git remote`, nothing on disk: a checkout is where
//! you happen to have cloned something, which has no bearing on whose
//! statistics you may want to read.
//!
//! # Discovery is CHEAP; measurement is separate
//!
//! The rule is `hooks.ts:712-717`'s, the one every expensive hook in this
//! app already follows: enumerate on entering the view, measure nothing
//! until something is clicked. So this module fetches **no statistics at
//! all** -- not a count, not a PR, not a leaderboard. It returns names.
//!
//! That is affordable in a way worth stating precisely, because the whole
//! design rests on it. MEASURED live, `gh api graphql`, 2026-09-11, this
//! account (2 orgs: FNX-Labs 4 members / 49 repos, Stohic 4 / 10):
//!
//! | Query | Cost | Wall clock |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`orgs_query`] -- org logins + counts | 1 | 0.59s |
//! | [`tree_query`] -- both orgs' repos AND members, plus personal repos | 1 | 0.83-1.04s (3 runs) |
//!
//! **One point and about a second for the entire hierarchy**, because
//! rate-limit cost is driven by nested connections at the scale they are
//! *paged*, not by how many nodes come back -- the same fact
//! `poll.rs:1503-1580` records and #827 leant on. A 559-repo / 224-member
//! org measured cost 1 at 2.18-2.22s.
//!
//! # Ordering: most-recently-active, sorted by GitHub
//!
//! `repositories(orderBy: {field: PUSHED_AT, direction: DESC})` sorts
//! SERVER-SIDE at **cost 1** -- the same point an unordered connection
//! costs. VERIFIED: the 49 FNX-Labs repositories come back strictly
//! descending by `pushedAt` with no client-side sort, and a monotonicity
//! check over the live response found no inversion.
//!
//! This is worth being explicit about because #825 originally worried that
//! activity ordering would need the per-repo activity data that cheap
//! discovery exists to avoid fetching. It does not. There is no activity
//! probe and no extra request.
//!
//! ## The caveat, recorded so nobody "fixes" it into an expensive query
//!
//! `PUSHED_AT` is **any push, not pull-request activity**. A repository
//! whose only recent commit was a dependency bot outranks one with a
//! week-old human PR. That is a real limitation and it is accepted
//! deliberately:
//!
//! - It is still far better than alphabetical, which orders by nothing a
//!   user cares about.
//! - The honest alternative -- ordering by recent PR count -- needs
//!   exactly the per-repo activity query this design avoids: one search
//!   per repository, 49 of them for one org, before the user has clicked
//!   anything. That is the opposite of "discovery is cheap".
//!
//! So if the ordering proves misleading in use, the fix is a deliberate
//! second query behind the same explicit-load gate the statistics
//! themselves use -- NOT a silent upgrade of this tree into something that
//! costs 49 searches to draw a sidebar.
//!
//! [`RepoRow::pushed_at`] is carried into the UI for this reason: ordering
//! by recency is invisible unless the rows say when they were touched. A
//! user cannot otherwise tell whether position 12 is a week stale or three
//! years dead.
//!
//! # Degrading honestly (#825 requirement 2, the #769 lesson)
//!
//! `membersWithRole` needs organisation read permission. An org where the
//! token lacks it must SAY so rather than render an empty Members list,
//! because an empty list reads as "this org has no members" -- silence
//! read as success, which is the defect #769 was about and which
//! `client.rs:1140-1190` already has scar tissue for on the PR path.
//!
//! I measured what GitHub actually does rather than assuming, and the
//! result **changed the shape of the query**. A `FORBIDDEN` on one field
//! nulls the **entire parent organisation object**, not just that field:
//!
//! ```text
//! {"data":{"a":null},"errors":[{"type":"FORBIDDEN",
//!   "path":["a","ipAllowListEnabledSetting"], ...}]}
//! ```
//!
//! Two consequences, both load-bearing:
//!
//! 1. **Each org is a separate ALIAS, not an entry in
//!    `viewer.organizations.nodes`.** Inside a `nodes` list a nulled org
//!    is an anonymous hole -- there is no login left to label it with, so
//!    the UI could not name the organisation it failed to read. As
//!    aliases, [`orgs_query`] has already told us the login for every
//!    alias, so a null is attributable: see [`OrgTree::readable`].
//! 2. **The blast radius is exactly one alias.** VERIFIED by putting a
//!    forbidden field on one org beside a readable org and the viewer in
//!    one document: the bad org came back `null` while the good org kept
//!    all 4 members and 49 repositories and the viewer kept its 6. So one
//!    inaccessible organisation degrades to one labelled row and costs
//!    the others nothing.
//!
//! This works only because `client::graphql_partial_ok` keeps `data` when
//! `errors` is non-empty (`client.rs:256-270`). Octocrab's own
//! deserialization would have discarded the whole response -- so the
//! honest-degradation path here is inherited from that fix rather than
//! reinvented, and a regression there would turn one forbidden org into a
//! blank sidebar.
//!
//! # Truncation is reported, never silent
//!
//! Both connections are capped at [`PAGE`] nodes and `totalCount` keeps
//! telling the truth above it -- VERIFIED on a 559-repo / 224-member org:
//! 100 nodes returned, `totalCount` 559, `pageInfo.hasNextPage` true. So
//! [`OrgTree::repos_total`] beside a shorter [`OrgTree::repos`] is how a
//! row count that is a SAMPLE says so, which is #824 item 8's rule ("never
//! a bare number over a sample") applied to the tree. #802 and #790 both
//! shipped silent truncation; this does not.

///
/// - The **1,000-result cap slices differently**. An org-wide search is
///   capped across the whole org and is why #827 built probe-driven
///   slicing; a per-repository connection has no cap at all
///   (`scope.rs:needs_search`). A sum of 49 capped searches is not the
///   same number as one sliced org search, and neither is it the same as a
///   sum of 49 uncapped connections.
/// - The **row list may be truncated** ([`OrgTree::repos_truncated`]) and

///   would therefore silently omit both, while the org scope covers
///   everything GitHub has.
