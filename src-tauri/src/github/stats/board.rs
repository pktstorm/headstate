//! Per-author aggregates for one scope and window: the numbers behind
//! #826's Mine and Others views, and the three leaderboards.
//!
//! `fetch.rs` issues the requests and returns the raw alias map; this
//! module is the part that turns that map into people. The split is
//! deliberate and was left that way by #827 on purpose -- "`load_detail`
//! returns the raw alias map rather than a leaderboard struct, because
//! #826 defines that shape and this layer should not pre-empt it".
//!
//! # What a board is, and what it is NOT
//!
//! One row per author who appears in the window, carrying the four
//! measures a scope page shows: pull requests, lines changed, files
//! touched, reviews received. From those rows the UI takes two views --
//! the viewer's own row ("Mine") and everybody else's ("Others") -- plus
//! three rankings.
//!
//! It is not a census of the organisation. An author appears because they
//! merged or opened something in the window; a member with no activity is
//! **absent**, and that absence is the honest answer rather than a zero
//! row. #826 states the rule: "a member with no activity in the window
//! reads as 'no activity', not a zero that might be a failed query". The
//! difference matters because a zero and a refusal look identical once
//! they are both rendered as `0`, and two features in this repo have
//! already shipped that confusion (#802, #790).
//!
//! # Completeness, and where it can fail
//!
//! A leaderboard is a RANKING, which makes it far less forgiving of
//! missing data than a count is. A total that is 5% short is a slightly
//! wrong number; a top-five that is 5% short can have the wrong person in
//! first place. So [`Board`] carries three distinct partiality channels,
//! none of which collapses into another:
//!
//! | Field | What it means | Why it is its own field |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`Board::complete`] | every PR in the window was retrieved | a ranking over a sample is not a ranking |
//! | [`Board::truncated_slices`] | some slice returned fewer nodes than its own `issueCount` | names WHICH part is short, and by how much |
//! | [`Board::refused_fields`] | GitHub refused fields on a response | a refusal is not an absence |
//!
//! The third is the one #827 left open. Its `Outcome::refused_fields` is
//! `0` on the sliced path because "per-slice attribution of refusals needs
//! the detail-fetch mapping that #826 owns" -- this module is that
//! mapping, so the count is wired here rather than left at zero. See
//! [`Board::from_alias_map`].
//!
//! What it is NOT is per-slice attribution, and the difference is worth
//! stating rather than letting a reader assume the stronger property.
//! `graphql_partial_ok` folds a response's `errors` array into a single
//! `__refused` COUNT on `data` (`client.rs:1204-1213`), discarding the
//! `path` that says which field was refused. So a board can say how many
//! fields were refused across the load; it cannot say which author's
//! additions are short. Attributing a refusal to a slice would need
//! `graphql_partial_ok` to carry the paths through, which is a change to
//! 80 lines of hard-won behaviour that every other query in the app
//! depends on -- and the UI consequence is the same either way, since a
//! board with any refusal is presented as incomplete rather than as a
//! ranking with a footnote.
//!
//! # Measurements behind the document this reads
//!
//! Mine, live API, `gh api graphql`, 2026-09-11, `org:FNX-Labs`.
//!
//! ## `reviews { totalCount }` is FREE, and the epic's premise was wrong
//!
//! #823 and #826 both record that `reviews { totalCount }` is "a
//! connection, priced per search", and #826 settled the review leaderboard
//! as "proceed, reassess if it bites" on that basis. **It does not cost a
//! point.** What is priced is a connection that PAGES -- one carrying a
//! `first:` argument -- not one read for `totalCount` alone:
//!
//! | Nested field on each PR node | 3 searches | 6 searches | 15 searches |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | scalars only (the control) | 1 | 1 | 1 |
//! | `reviews { totalCount }` | 1 | 1 | 1 |
//! | `reviews(first: 1) { totalCount }` | 1 | **2** | **2** |
//! | `reviews(first: 1) { nodes { state } }` | 1 | **2** | **2** |
//! | `labels { totalCount }` | 1 | 1 | - |
//! | `labels(first: 10) { nodes { name } }` | 1 | **2** | - |
//! | `reviewThreads { totalCount }` | 1 | 1 | - |
//!
//! The same field is free without `first:` and priced with it, for both
//! `reviews` and `labels` -- so the rule is the ARGUMENT, not the field.
//! That reconciles rather than contradicts `poll.rs:1503-1580`: every
//! connection in the cost list there is a paged one (`labels(first:`,
//! `reviewThreads(first:`, `contexts(first:`), so its measurements were
//! right about the queries it was measuring, and the generalisation to
//! "connections are priced per search" is what was too broad.
//!
//! The practical consequence: `reviews { totalCount }` rides along on this
//! document at no cost, so the reviewer leaderboard #826 asked for needs
//! no retreat plan. A test pins the spelling, because the difference
//! between the free form and the priced one is four characters.
//!
//! ## The document must be SMALLER than #827's chunk default
//!
//! `ALIAS_CHUNK` is 10 and `SLICE_PAGE_FULL` is 50, and that product does
//! not survive real dense data. Against day-slices of `org:FNX-Labs` in
//! 2026-08 (245 merged PRs across 10 days), three runs per cell:
//!
//! | Document | Succeeded | Wall clock |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 10 aliases x 50 | **0 of 3** | 10.6 / 10.6 / 10.6s -- all 502 |
//! | 10 aliases x 25 | 3 of 3 | 6.6-9.6s |
//! | 5 aliases x 50 | 3 of 3 | 4.2-4.9s |
//! | 5 aliases x 25 | 3 of 3 | 4.1-4.3s |
//! | 3 aliases x 50 | 3 of 3 | 2.3-3.7s |
//!
//! Every failure landed at 10.6s, which is #827's measured ~11s server
//! deadline exactly. Its own figure for this document was "3 aliases x 50:
//! 3.42-3.68s, ok 2/2" -- correct, and measured at a THIRD of the chunk
//! size it then shipped. Nothing between 3 and 10 was measured, and 10 is
//! where it breaks.
//!
//! I confirmed the cause is node volume rather than this date range or the
//! added `reviews` field: the identical 10 aliases count-only answered in
//! 1.4-1.5s, 10 x 50 carrying only scalars still straddled the deadline
//! (7.0-10.6s, 2 of 3), and 10 x 50 WITH `reviews` passed 3 of 3 at
//! 7.7-8.5s on a re-run. At 7-10s against an 11s wall the outcome is a
//! coin toss, which is why [`BOARD_ALIAS_CHUNK`] is 5 rather than 10.
//!
//! That is a narrowing of #827's constants for this document only, not a
//! correction of its reasoning -- its ladder already sheds pages before
//! aliases for exactly the reason these numbers show.
