//! The completeness mechanism: subdivide a window until every piece of it
//! fits inside GitHub's 1,000-result search cap.
//!
//! # The hazard
//!
//! GitHub search returns at most 1,000 retrievable results while
//! `issueCount` reports the true total. VERIFIED live 2026-09-11:
//! `is:pr org:FNX-Labs` reports **1,822**, and paginating to offset 1000
//! returns `[]` -- an empty node list, HTTP 200, no error, no warning.
//!
//! So a leaderboard computed by walking search results would be silently
//! wrong on any real organisation, and *silently* is the defect: the page
//! would render a confident top five built from a truncated sample. This
//! repo has shipped that exact shape twice -- #802's review threads and
//! #790's check contexts -- and both fixes were to make the truncation
//! visible. This module goes one better and makes it not happen.
//!
//! # Why the slicing must be probe-driven
//!
//! A calendar grid does not work, and this is measured rather than
//! argued. FNX-Labs, by year (live, 2026-09-11, cost 1 for all six
//! aliases): 2021 = 0, 2022 = 2, 2023 = 2, 2024 = 0, 2025 = 28,
//! **2026 = 1,790**. Then 2026 by quarter: Q1 = 9, Q2 = 521,
//! **Q3 = 1,260**. Then Q3 by month: July = 461, August = 706,
//! September = 93.
//!
//! Every level of that grid has at least one bucket over the cap until
//! the third. A yearly grid truncates 790 PRs; a quarterly grid truncates
//! 260; a monthly grid happens to work *today* and will not the moment
//! August gets busier. The subdivision has to be driven by the measured
//! count, which is what makes it correct for a scope nobody has measured.
//!
//! (The 9 / 521 / 1,260 figures reproduce #823's exactly, which is worth
//! noting: the epic's premise holds, and this module is not working
//! around it.)
//!
//! # Why this is affordable
//!
//! A probe is `issueCount` with no nodes, and an aliased document of them
//! costs 1 point in total regardless of alias count -- MEASURED at 36, 60
//! and 80 aliases on 2026-09-11, and already recorded at 66 aliases in
//! `query.rs:212-219`. So a whole level of the recursion is ONE request,
//! and the depth is logarithmic in the activity. The FNX-Labs case above
//! resolves in four rounds.
