/// How many stats reads may be in flight at once.
///
/// # Why reads need a cap at all
///
/// `BATCH_CONCURRENCY = 4` in `commands.rs:437-444` caps MUTATIONS,
/// because "GitHub applies secondary rate limits to concurrent
/// mutations". Reads have had no equivalent, and the shape that needs one
/// already exists: `fetch_history_values` (`client.rs:947-986`) spawns
/// `days / HISTORY_CHUNK_DAYS` concurrent POSTs, which is **18** at the
/// 90-day clamp. That has been fine because 18 is the ceiling and it is
/// reached only by one user action.
///
/// This feature has no such ceiling. An org-scope leaderboard fans out
/// over probe rounds, then over slices, then potentially over members --
/// the product of three counts that all depend on how much activity the
/// scope contains. Unbounded, a busy org is exactly the "many concurrent
/// requests from one client" shape that secondary limits exist to stop,
/// and a secondary limit is not a clean 403: GitHub's documented
/// behaviour is to start refusing, and octocrab is configured
/// `HandleRateLimits { max_retries: 3, min_wait_seconds: 60 }`
/// (`client.rs:1070-1076`), so each refusal becomes a 60-second wait
/// inside a request that the layer above simply waits on.
///
/// # Why 6
///
/// Bounded from below by the shipped evidence and from above by the
/// mutation cap's reasoning:
///
/// - **Not below 4.** `fetch_history_values` has shipped at 18 concurrent
///   reads without a reported secondary-limit failure, so the real
///   threshold is above 18 and a cap of 1 or 2 would be slower than what
///   already works for no measured reason.
/// - **Not 18.** That number is an accident of `HISTORY_CHUNK_DAYS` and
///   the 90-day clamp, not a measurement of anything. Inheriting it would
///   be inheriting a coincidence.
/// - **6, because the latency it has to hide is ~2-11s per request.** I
///   measured a 10-alias probe document at 1.78-1.81s and the expensive
///   node-heavy document at 3.69-5.21s for 12 aliases (live, 2026-09-11).
///   Six in flight covers 60 slices per round-trip at the probe shape,
///   which plans the whole 1,822-PR FNX-Labs history in one round-trip's
///   worth of wall clock. Going wider buys less and less -- the planner
///   needs at most `ALIAS_CHUNK` x 6 = 60 slices per round and rarely
///   that many -- while the risk it adds is a secondary limit whose
///   penalty is a 60-second stall, not a retry.
///
/// Deliberately HIGHER than the mutation cap of 4 and deliberately
/// stated: a mutation that trips a secondary limit may have partially
/// applied and has to be reasoned about, where a refused read is just a
/// read to do again. The asymmetry is the justification for the two
/// numbers differing rather than being unified.

/// Wall-clock ceiling on one whole scope load.
///
/// # Why this is not `poll::FETCH_TIMEOUT`
///
/// `poll::FETCH_TIMEOUT` is 30s and bounds ONE fetch. Its own doc
/// (`poll.rs:709-736`) explains the property that sets it: it must be
/// below `MIN_FOCUSED_SECS` so a hung poll lands strictly before the next
/// tick, or two fetches overlap and each spends budget. A stats load has
/// no cadence and no successor to collide with, so that constraint does
/// not apply here and copying 30s would be copying a number for a reason
/// that is not present.
///
/// What DOES apply is the reason it exists at all, and it applies more
/// strongly: octocrab is `HandleRateLimits { max_retries: 3,
/// min_wait_seconds: 60 }` (`client.rs:1070-1076`), so **one POST can
/// legitimately block for minutes** while every layer above it waits. A
/// load issuing dozens of POSTs inherits that per-POST hazard dozens of
/// times over. Only a wall-clock ceiling around the whole thing bounds
/// what the user is actually waiting on -- the same argument
/// `commands::get_pr_detail` makes at `commands.rs:604-633`, and the same
/// one that #790 shipped without.
///
/// # Why 60s
///
/// Derived from what a load legitimately needs, at measured latencies:
///
/// - A probe round is one request per [`ALIAS_CHUNK`] slices, measured at
///   1.78-1.81s for 10 aliases. The FNX-Labs history plans in 4 rounds,
///   so planning is ~8s even when every round is serial (they are, by
///   construction -- each round's slices depend on the last round's
///   counts).
/// - A detail fetch is one request per chunk, measured at 3.42-3.68s for
///   3 aliases at the default 50-node page over the densest slices in this
///   account, and those ARE parallel at [`READ_CONCURRENCY`]. The
///   FNX-Labs plan lands ~16 slices, which is two waves: ~10s.
///
/// So a worst realistic load is ~20-25s, and 60s is between two and three
/// times that. Generous on purpose, for the reason `get_pr_detail`'s
/// comment gives: "the budget exists to convert an unbounded hang into an
/// actionable error, not to tighten a latency target". A real load that
/// needs 40 seconds should succeed.
///
/// Bounded ABOVE by what a user will sit in front of. This is behind an
/// explicit load (#823 item 4), so the user asked and is watching; a
/// ceiling past a minute is a ceiling nobody waits for.
pub const LOAD_TIMEOUT: std::time::Duration = std::time::Duration::from_secs(60);

/// Nodes per slice on the first attempt, and after degrading.
///
/// The ladder is `client.rs:1024-1050`'s, inherited rather than
/// reinvented: `MERGED_DETAIL_QUERY` halves `first: 100` to 50 when the

/// What is left to do is unknowable here for the same reason the planner is
/// probe-driven. Projecting the remaining load would need a number nobody
/// has; projecting the NEXT wave needs only the wave's own size, and
/// refusing a wave stops the load just as effectively one wave later. The
