//! Applying dependency updates in a throwaway worktree.
//!
//! The FIRST code in this app that runs a package manager in a mode that
//! writes. Everything else in `packages/` queries -- `outdated`, `list`,
//! `show --outdated` -- so the care here is deliberate and the contract
//! is borrowed from `pull_checkout`, the only other write path: re-check
//! state fresh rather than trusting a scan, do the narrowest operation
//! that answers the request, and return the tool's OWN error rather than
//! a generic one.
//!
//! Phase 1 does not push and does not open a pull request. It leaves a
//! worktree with changes applied for the user to inspect. That boundary
//! is the point: what these tools actually do to a checkout is not
//! knowable from documentation, and the way to find out is to look at
//! the result before adding anything irreversible on top.
//!
//! ## The resolver decides, not the request
//!
//! Asking for `1.2.3` does not mean `1.2.3` is what lands. Resolvers
//! reconcile the whole dependency graph, and a peer conflict, a
//! transitive pin, or a yanked release can produce something else --
//! or nothing. So every apply is followed by a re-read of the manifest
//! state, and the report says what is ACTUALLY there. A wizard that
//! echoes back the version it asked for is not reporting, it is
//! guessing.
