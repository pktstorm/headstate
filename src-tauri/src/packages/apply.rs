//! Applying dependency updates in a throwaway worktree.
//!
//! The FIRST code in this app that runs a package manager in a mode that
//! writes. Everything else in `packages/` queries -- `outdated`, `list`,
//! `show --outdated` -- so the care here is deliberate and the contract
//! is borrowed from `pull_checkout`, the only other write path: re-check
//! state fresh rather than trusting a scan, do the narrowest operation
//! that answers the request, and return the tool's OWN error rather than
//! a generic one.
//!
//! Phase 1 does not push and does not open a pull request. It leaves a
//! worktree with changes applied for the user to inspect. That boundary
//! is the point: what these tools actually do to a checkout is not
//! knowable from documentation, and the way to find out is to look at
//! the result before adding anything irreversible on top.
//!
//! ## The resolver decides, not the request
//!
//! Asking for `1.2.3` does not mean `1.2.3` is what lands. Resolvers
//! reconcile the whole dependency graph, and a peer conflict, a
//! transitive pin, or a yanked release can produce something else --
//! or nothing. So every apply is followed by a re-read of the manifest
//! state, and the report says what is ACTUALLY there. A wizard that
//! echoes back the version it asked for is not reporting, it is
//! guessing.

/// # Why the name changed (#797)
///
/// It used to be `headstate/updates-<count>`, where the count was the
/// NUMBER OF PACKAGES. Three things were wrong with that at once, and the
/// third is the one that broke a real workflow:
///
/// 1. `153` read as an issue or pull request number. Every other number
///    in this app's UI is one, and a quantity nobody asked for is a poor
///    use of the one field a reader scans.
/// 2. It said nothing about what the run WAS. The ecosystem is on every
///    request already, so the run's own identity was being thrown away.
/// 3. Keying on a COUNT means two runs in the same repository that happen
///    to touch the same number of packages produce the same name, and
///    `create_worktree` refuses when the branch or directory exists. So
///    the second run failed outright -- loudly, which is correct of the
///    guard, but the collision only existed because the name encoded a
///    quantity rather than anything distinguishing.
///
/// Uniqueness per run mattered more than the exact spelling, so the name
/// is now `headstate/<ecosystem>-deps-<UTC timestamp to the second>`:
/// `headstate/poetry-deps-20260911-064512`.
///
/// ## Why a timestamp rather than a hash or a counter
///
/// A hash of the package list collides for exactly the runs that need
/// telling apart -- re-running the same selection after a failure is the
/// common case -- and says nothing a reader can use. A "next free
/// number" counter needs to ask git what exists, which the wizard cannot
/// do without the round trip #409 exists to avoid. A timestamp is
/// unique at the only granularity that matters here (one update run per
/// repository at a time, enforced by `runs::UpdateRuns::start`), sorts
/// chronologically in `git branch` output, and tells the reader when the
/// work happened -- which is the question a stranded update branch
/// actually raises.
///
/// It is NOT mistakable for an issue number: eight digits, a dash, six
/// more. `-deps-` in the middle says what the run was about, so the
/// worktree directory leaf (`worktree_path` takes the branch's last
/// segment) reads as `poetry-deps-20260911-064512` rather than the bare
/// `updates-153` that started the investigation in #797.
///
/// ## What did NOT change
///
/// The `headstate/` prefix. #797 records that `headstate/` reads as a
/// repo name rather than a creator, and that a different prefix would be
/// better -- but it affects every existing branch in every repository, so
/// it is deliberately left as a FOLLOW-UP and out of scope here. Existing
/// `headstate/updates-*` branches and their `.worktrees/` directories are
/// untouched; only newly created runs get the new shape.
///
/// ## The single-package case
///
/// Dropped, along with the package name it carried. It was the one case
/// where the old name said something useful, but it was also the case
/// where two runs collide most readily -- bumping `lodash` twice is
/// ordinary -- and a name whose shape depends on how many packages were
/// selected is a name the wizard has to re-derive on every checkbox
/// click. One shape for every run is predictable for the user and for the
/// mirror. The packages are still listed in the pull request body, which
/// is where a list of nine belongs.
///
/// `_packages` is kept in the signature and deliberately unused: every
/// caller has the list, and a name that wants a package in it again
/// should not need the call sites rewritten to get one. Underscored to say
/// so, matching `_names` in the TypeScript mirror.
