//! Rust crates, read from `Cargo.toml` plus `Cargo.lock`.
//!
//! The third ecosystem here that needs NO tool installed, and for the
//! same reason as Terraform: everything the question needs is a file on
//! disk plus an HTTP GET.
//!
//! Cargo has no `npm outdated`. The candidates were `cargo outdated` and
//! `cargo upgrade --dry-run` (cargo-edit), both third-party subcommands
//! the user must install first -- and a missing binary is exactly what
//! turns a check into a confident empty list, which is the inversion
//! this whole module exists to refuse. `cargo` itself is on the machine
//! by definition if there is a `Cargo.toml`, but it answers a different
//! question: `cargo update --dry-run` reports what the RESOLVER would
//! move to within the existing constraints, not what the newest
//! published version is.
//!
//! So this reads the two files and asks the crates.io sparse index.
//!
//! ## Two files, two different jobs
//!
//! - `Cargo.toml` says WHICH crates this project declares. It is the
//!   list the page must show.
//! - `Cargo.lock` says WHICH VERSION is actually in use. It is the only
//!   place the resolved version exists -- a manifest constraint of `"1"`
//!   is not a version.
//!
//! Reporting from the lock alone would list the entire transitive tree:
//! `src-tauri/Cargo.lock` holds over six hundred packages, of which
//! roughly thirty are declared. A page listing six hundred rows, most of
//! them crates the user has never chosen and cannot directly update, is
//! not a report -- so the manifest decides membership and the lock only
//! supplies numbers.
//!
//! Nothing here runs a command or writes a file.
