//! Latest versions for the ecosystems with no local command.
//!
//! Terraform providers and Swift packages are the two whose "what is the
//! newest version" answer lives in an HTTP registry rather than in a
//! tool on the machine. Every other ecosystem here spawns a subprocess
//! and parses its stdout; these two cannot, because there is nothing to
//! spawn -- `terraform providers` reports CONSTRAINTS and does not diff,
//! and nothing at all reports outdated Xcode-managed Swift packages.
//!
//! That makes this the only part of `packages` that is async, and it is
//! why the check runs in two phases: a synchronous pass reports the
//! pinned versions immediately, and this fills in the latest afterwards.
//! A Terraform repository renders its providers at once rather than
//! blocking on the network.
//!
//! Nothing here writes to a file or runs a command.
