            // READING: the row still opened with a loss ("directory is
            // gone") and a piece of git vocabulary ("prunable"), while the
            // reassurance that nothing can be lost lived only in a
            // tooltip. The issue was filed twice, which is the signal --
            // the page was answering "can I clear this?" with a
            // vocabulary lesson instead of a yes.
            //
