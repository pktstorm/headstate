//! What the machine is doing, and what Headstate is costing it.
//!
//! One sample a minute while the app runs, kept for 24 hours
//! (`store::health`). The view reads the current sample live and the
//! series for its charts.
//!
//! # What is NOT here
//!
//! **Temperature in degrees.** On macOS the SMC is only readable with
//! elevated privileges -- `powermetrics --samplers smc` requires sudo,
//! and there is no unprivileged path -- so a degrees reading would work
//! only for a user who ran the app as root. What IS available is the
//! platform's thermal PRESSURE, a coarse label, and that is what
//! [`Sample::thermal`] carries. The UI says so rather than letting a
//! label that looks like a temperature imply one.
//!
//! **The GPU, on most platforms.** macOS answers through IOKit and
//! Linux answers for AMD cards through sysfs. Intel on Linux genuinely
//! cannot be read without `CAP_PERFMON`; Windows and NVIDIA-on-Linux
//! could be, but each needs machinery (a PDH loop, a hand-declared NVML
//! ABI) that `sysinfo` is about to provide for free. [`Sample::gpus`]
//! is empty on all of them and the view draws no panel, which is the
//! same rule as everything else here. [`gpu`] carries the evidence
//! behind each verdict.
//!
//! **Per-process network, on every platform but macOS.** macOS answers
//! through `nettop`, at a cost of ~5 SECONDS a reading -- two orders of
//! magnitude past anything else here, and equal to the whole live poll
//! interval. So it is deliberately NOT part of [`Sample`] and not on
//! this timer at all: it has its own command and runs only while the
//! Network detail page is open. Linux has no unprivileged route and
//! Windows' is real work nobody has done; both report nothing and the
//! view says why. [`netproc`] carries the measurements and the
//! per-platform evidence.
//!
//! # Absent is not zero
//!
//! Every optional field is `None` when the platform does not expose it,
//! never `0.0`. A zero that means "not measured" reads as a real
//! measurement, which is the failure `packages::run::missing_tool`
//! exists to avoid on the other side of the app: "no updates" and "the
//! check did not run" are opposite answers.
//!
//! # The two halves of "what Headstate costs"
//!
//! [`Sample`] is the machine. [`Footprint`] (`footprint`) is this app's
//! own share of it -- our process, the `git`/`gh`/Docker subprocesses we
//! spawn, and the Docker daemon we keep resident. That is the LIVE half
//! only: the disk half of the same panel is `size_worktrees`,
//! `size_artifacts`, `size_venvs` and `docker_disk_usage`, which already
//! exist and are slow enough (~13s, #661) that they must stay behind an
//! explicit "Measure" and out of the sampler.
