//! Deciding when busy CPU is a FAULT rather than work (#791).
//!
//! Ten orphaned `yes` processes burned a core each for two days on the
//! reporting machine and nothing noticed. This module is the part of
//! #791 that ships: the aggregate rule, plus a shadow log of what the
//! two per-process rules WOULD have said.
//!
//! # Why the obvious rule is not here
//!
//! "100% CPU for five minutes" would have caught those ten and would
//! also fire on every `yarn build`, Vite dev server, `terraform plan`,
//! alembic migration, ollama run and Rust compile on the same machine.
//! That is alert fatigue inside a day, and an ignored alert is worse
//! than no alert. The CPU LEVEL was never the distinguishing signal:
//! duration, orphanhood and doing no work were.
//!
//! # What ships, and what is only logged
//!
//! | tier | rule | this release |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 3 | total CPU >= [`AGGREGATE_PERCENT`] for >= [`AGGREGATE_MINUTES`] min, no single process explains it | **alerts** |
//! | watch | a process >= [`WATCH_PERCENT`] for >= [`WATCH_MINUTES`] min, not allowlisted (#865) | [`Notice`], page only |
//! | load | load average / cores >= [`OVERSUBSCRIBED_RATIO`] for >= [`OVERSUBSCRIBED_MINUTES`] min (#872) | [`Notice`], page only |
//! | 1 | a process >= [`TIER1_PERCENT`] for >= [`TIER1_MINUTES`] min, PPID 1, not allowlisted | shadow log only |
//! | 2 | a process >= [`TIER2_PERCENT`] for >= [`TIER2_MINUTES`] min | shadow log only |
//!
//! A [`Notice`] is an INDICATOR and an [`Alert`] is an INTERRUPTION, and
//! the two are kept apart on purpose: the watch tier and the load rule
//! both describe conditions that a large build produces legitimately, so
//! notifying on either would be the #853 outcome (~40 false positives,
//! guard turned off). They reach `health_alerts` and the System Health
//! page; nothing converts one into an `Alert`, and two tests assert that
//! rather than leaving it to review.
//!
//! # Why load average is here at all (#872)
//!
//! Because `cpu_percent` SATURATES and load average does not. The mean
//! of per-core usage is capped at 100, so twelve busy cores and twelve
//! busy cores with forty-one more threads queued behind them read the
//! same. #865's incident reached **load average 53 on 12 cores** and no
//! rule in this module consulted it -- the aggregate rule saw 50%
//! machine-wide and stayed under its own 60% bar. Load average is the one
//! signal that says how many things are waiting for a core that does not
//! exist, and it was already being sampled and stored the whole time.
//!
//! Tier 3 ships because it is satisfiable against the schema that
//! already exists: `cpu_percent` is stored per sample
//! (`store::schema`), and `store::health::history` is already
//! gap-preserving and downsampled, so the rule is arithmetic over a
//! series the charts already draw. It is also the rule that matters
//! most for the incident that prompted the issue -- ten processes at
//! 93% each looked unremarkable in a list sorted by CPU, which is
//! exactly why they hid for two days. Ten processes at 93% is a
//! different condition from one at 93%, and **only an aggregate rule
//! sees it**.
//!
//! Tiers 1 and 2 are logged and notify for nothing, deliberately.
//! Their thresholds -- 30 minutes, 2 hours -- were reasoned from one
//! machine's workload, not measured against a baseline. The issue asks
//! for a week of would-be firings before any of them interrupts
//! anyone, and that log is the only thing that turns those numbers
//! from plausible into justified. [`Shadow`] is that log and nothing
//! more: it has no [`Alert`] variant, so there is no path from it to a
//! notification even by accident.
//!
//! Deferred with the notifications, and deliberately NOT built here:
//! per-PID duration tracking as persisted storage keyed on
//! `(pid, start_time)`, the maintained full-path daemon allowlist,
//! sibling-cluster detection, and the idle-work/IO check. #791 keeps
//! them; this release adds no migration.
//!
//! # Everything that decides anything is pure
//!
//! [`evaluate`] and [`shadow`] take data and return verdicts. Neither
//! touches a clock, a database, the process table or a notification
//! API -- the same rule `alerts::evaluate` follows, and for the same
//! reason: the cases this module exists for ("a two-day-old condition
//! must not read as fifteen minutes of burn") are testable as
//! arithmetic instead of by arranging hardware to misbehave for a
//! quarter of an hour.
//!
//! # Gap discipline is the whole of the duration rule
//!
//! The sampler runs at 60s cadence and ONLY while the app is open
//! (`lib.rs`), so a fifteen-minute rule is about fifteen samples and
//! cannot span an app restart or a closed lid. Without gap discipline
//! the first sample after a two-day absence sits next to the last one
//! before it, and a condition nobody watched would be "detected" as
//! fifteen minutes of sustained burn the moment the app reopens --
//! reporting a window the app was not running for.
//!
//! So every duration here is measured over CONSECUTIVE samples no more
//! than [`alerts::GAP_MS`] apart, and a gap ends the run rather than
//! being skipped over. That is the same constant, and the same
//! refusal, as the battery rate rules; `a_gap_is_not_sustained_burn`
//! below is the mutation test for it.
//!
//! # Why Tier 3 needs "no single process explains it"
//!
//! Total CPU at 60% is completely ordinary during a build. What is not
//! ordinary is 60% that no single process accounts for: that is either
//! a fan-out nobody asked for (a spawn loop, a stuck parallel job) or
//! a pile of orphans each individually too small to notice. The
//! largest single share is therefore part of the rule, not decoration
//! -- see [`Aggregate::largest_share`] and
//! [`SINGLE_PROCESS_EXPLAINS`].
//!
//! That share is a LIVE reading and the history is not: per-process
//! data lives in `health::footprint`, is sampled on demand and is
//! never persisted. So the duration half of the rule comes from the
//! stored series and the "no single process" half from the current
//! process table, which is sound because the question the second half
//! answers is about now: if one process explains the load at this
//! instant, the machine is busy rather than broken, and the whole
//! point of the rule is that nothing in the list looks wrong.
