//! Step-up signatures for destructive commands: the desktop side of
//! "Step-up for destructive commands" in the design spec.
//!
//! A phone that wants to delete something proves, per request, that it
//! still holds the biometric-gated signing keys it registered at pairing.
//! [`verify`] is the whole check and is transport-agnostic: the
//! `POST /v1/call/{command}` handler in `remote/listener.rs` calls it with
//! the paired device, the parsed body, and the raw header value, BEFORE
//! `surface::dispatch`, and only when `surface::class_of` says the
//! command is destructive. Read and write commands carry no signature.
//!
//! # What is here and what is in `headstate-stepup`
//!
//! The protocol itself -- the canonical bytes both signatures cover, the
//! `X-Headstate-Signature` grammar, and the verification of both
//! signatures -- lives in the `headstate-stepup` crate, which the phone
//! (`src-mobile`) and its keys plugin depend on by the same path. Read
//! that crate's docs for the header, the signed bytes, and the order of
//! checks; there is nothing to read twice, which is the point (#695).
//!
//! What is here is what only the desktop has: the [`NonceWindow`] that
//! remembers a verified nonce for as long as it could be replayed, the
//! adapter from a [`PairedDevice`] row to the two public keys the
//! verifier wants, and the native notification a destructive command
//! posts. None of that has a byte on the wire, so none of it belongs in
//! a crate the phone links.
//!
//! # Mounting
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // In the /v1/call/{command} handler, after the client certificate has
//! // been mapped to its PairedDevice row and before dispatch:
//! if class == Class::Destructive {
//!     let header = headers.get(HEADER).and_then(|v| v.to_str().ok());
//!     stepup::verify(&device, &command, &args, header, Utc::now().timestamp(), &nonces)
//!         .map_err(|e| (e.http_status(), e.to_string()))?;
//! }
//! let out = surface::dispatch(&app, &command, args, &device.name).await?;
//! if class == Class::Destructive {
//!     stepup::notify_destructive(&app, &device.name, &command);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `nonces` is one [`NonceWindow`] for the whole listener, managed in
//! Tauri state or held in the router; it is `Send + Sync` and takes
//! `&self`.
