//! The mTLS listener a paired phone talks to.
//!
//! axum on a tokio task, port [`PORT`] on every interface (IPv4 and
//! IPv6 on one dual-stack socket), TLS 1.3 only, rustls on the aws-lc-rs
//! provider. Client certificates are required at the handshake and
//! checked by fingerprint against the paired devices -- no CA, no chain
//! -- so an unpaired client never reaches HTTP.
//!
//! # The seams
//!
//! The listener does not know how devices are stored or how commands
//! run. It asks a [`PairedCerts`] -- "is this fingerprint paired, and
//! what are its keys?" and "is a pairing window open?" -- which
//! `gate.rs` implements over the pairing state's in-memory copy of
//! `paired_devices`; and it hands each `/v1/call` to a [`CommandHost`],
//! which `gate.rs` implements over `surface::dispatch`. Both are traits
//! so the whole surface can be driven end to end on loopback with no
//! database file and no Tauri app (`remote/loopback_tests.rs`).
//!
//! # What the handshake admits, and what HTTP then allows
//!
//! At the TLS layer a certificate is admitted if it is paired, OR if a
//! pairing window is open -- the phone about to pair has no row yet and
//! must get as far as `POST /v1/pair`. Above TLS, [`require_paired`]
//! lets an unpaired peer reach [`PAIR_PATH`] and nothing else, and
//! re-asks `is_paired` on EVERY request rather than trusting the
//! handshake, so a device revoked mid-connection is refused on its next
//! request, not only its next handshake. Handlers find who is calling
//! in the [`Peer`] request extension.
//!
//! Revocation also closes the connections a revoked certificate already
//! has open, as the spec says: every connection task watches the
//! pairing task's revocation broadcast and, on its own fingerprint,
//! shuts the HTTP connection down gracefully -- an in-flight response
//! finishes (the `/v1/events` stream ends itself on the same broadcast)
//! and nothing further is served -- with a short deadline after which
//! the connection is dropped regardless.
//!
//! # Routes and statuses
//!
//! - `GET /v1/hello`, `GET /v1/events`: see [`Hello`] and `remote/events.rs`.
//! - `POST /v1/pair`: `remote/pairing.rs`. 200 with a `PairOutcome`;
//!   400 for a body that does not decode; otherwise `PairError::http_status`.
//! - `POST /v1/call/{command}`: `remote/surface.rs` and `remote/stepup.rs`.
//!   200 with the command's JSON result; 404 unknown command, 403
//!   desktop-only command or not paired, 400 for a body that is not JSON
//!   or does not decode as the command's arguments, 500 when the command
//!   itself failed (the body is its message); a destructive command's
//!   signature is checked first and refused with `StepUpError::http_status`.
//!
//! Error bodies are plain text: the message the matching error type
//! prints, which is written to be safe to send.
