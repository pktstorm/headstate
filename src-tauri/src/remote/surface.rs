//! The remote allowlist: the single place that decides what a paired
//! phone can do.
//!
//! Every Tauri command registered in `lib.rs`'s `generate_handler!` has
//! exactly one row in [`SURFACE`], and the row's [`Class`] is the whole
//! policy. A command added to `generate_handler!` without a row here
//! fails [`tests::every_registered_command_has_exactly_one_class`], so a
//! new command can be neither exposed nor omitted silently.
//!
//! # Contract for the `POST /v1/call/{command}` handler
//!
//! The HTTP route lives in `remote/listener.rs`, not here. The handler
//! that mounts it must:
//!
//! 1. Read `{command}` from the path and the JSON body as
//!    `serde_json::Value` (an object of camelCase keys, exactly what the
//!    webview passes to `invoke`; an empty or absent body is `{}`).
//! 2. Look the command up with [`class_of`]. When it is
//!    [`Class::Destructive`], verify the `X-Headstate-Signature` step-up
//!    header (nonce, timestamp, and every signature the pairing record
//!    expects) BEFORE calling [`dispatch`]. `dispatch` does not check
//!    signatures; it trusts that the caller already refused a destructive
//!    request without a valid one.
//! 3. Call [`dispatch`] with the paired device's name and map the result:
//!    `Ok(value)` is the response body, and each [`RemoteError`] variant
//!    documents the status it should become.
//!
//! `dispatch` refuses [`Class::Local`] and unknown commands itself, so a
//! handler that skips step 2 for a non-destructive command is still safe;
//! it is the signature check that only the handler can do.
