//! The stats answer cache.
//!
//! One job: remember what GitHub already said about a closed time window,
//! so navigating back to a scope does not re-spend the request budget on
//! a number that cannot have changed.
//!
//! # This had to be built, not reused
//!
//! `schema.rs` migration 2 dropped `merge_history`, the table the original
//! stats design planned, because it was never written to -- and
//! `store/mod.rs` records that its SHAPE was wrong besides: it
//! accumulated merges by diffing the open PR set, where a PR leaving that
//! set may have been closed unmerged. Reusing it would have contradicted
//! the `is:merged` search that must stay authoritative.
//!
//! This module does not accumulate. It memoises an answer, keyed by the
//! question that produced it, and GitHub stays the only source of truth.
//! The test at the bottom asserts this table is actually written to, so it
//! cannot become the second permanently-empty table implying a feature
//! that does not exist.
//!
//! # Why a closed window is cacheable FOREVER
//!
//! The PRs merged in August 2026 are fixed once August is over. A
//! leaderboard over that window is a constant, so recomputing it per
//! navigation is pure waste -- and expensive waste, because recomputing
//! means the probe rounds and slice fetches of `github::stats::fetch`
//! against a 5,000-point hourly budget.
//!
//! A window that includes TODAY is a different thing entirely and gets a
//! short freshness bound. [`is_closed`] is where that line is drawn, and
//! it is drawn on the window's own end date rather than on the row's age,
//! because the age of the row tells you nothing about whether its answer
//! can still move.
//!
//! # Why three kinds of answer share one table (#836)
//!
//! Until #836 only `stats_count` cached, which is the CHEAPEST of the
//! three stats queries. `commands::stats_count` projects a count at
//! `days/5 + 8` -- about 26 points for 90 days -- while
//! `commands::board_projection` computes roughly 45 for the same window,
//! and `commands::stats_board`'s own doc calls a board over a busy org
//! "seconds" of node fetching. So the cache covered the query that costs
//! least to recompute and skipped the two that cost most.
//!
//! The argument above applies HARDER to a board than to a count: a
//! leaderboard over a month that has ended is as constant as a total over
//! it, and far more expensive to rebuild. The blocker was never the
//! schema -- `payload` is already an opaque blob and `complete` already
//! carries partiality -- it was that `StatsQuery::cache_key` has no
//! subject for a board (a board is about EVERYONE), so every board in a
//! scope would have collided with that scope's `*`-subject count.
//!
//! [`Kind`] is that missing discriminator, and it lives here rather than
//! in `StatsQuery::cache_key` because it is a property of the STORED
//! ANSWER's shape, not of the question's scope: a board and a count can
//! be built from the very same `StatsQuery`, and only the caller knows
//! which one it is about to write. Keeping it here also means a new
//! cached answer shape is one variant in this file, not a change to the
//! query model every stats path depends on.
//!
//! One consequence, accepted deliberately: rows written before #836 have
//! un-prefixed keys and will never be read again. They are a handful of
//! stale counts per user, served to nobody, and migrating them would mean
//! a schema migration to rewrite a cache -- a cache being exactly the
//! thing it is safe to lose. `put`'s `INSERT OR REPLACE` cannot collide
//! with them either, because no new key is un-prefixed.
