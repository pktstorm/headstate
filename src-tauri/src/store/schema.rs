    // battery at 0% of its design capacity is a dead battery, and

    //
    // Migration 2 above dropped `merge_history`, the table the original
    // stats design planned, as "never written to... rather than left as a
    // permanently-empty table implying a feature that does not exist".
    // `store/mod.rs` records the deeper reason it was the wrong shape: it
    // accumulated merges by diffing the open set, and a PR leaving that
    // set is not necessarily a merge, so it would have recorded abandoned
    // PRs as merges and contradicted the `is:merged` search that must
    // stay authoritative.
    //
    // This table does not accumulate anything. It memoises an ANSWER
    // GitHub already gave, keyed by the question, and GitHub's `is:merged`
    // search stays the only source of truth. That is the difference, and
    // it is why reusing the old table would have been wrong even if it
    // still existed.
    //
    // # Why caching is correct here and not merely fast
    //
    // A leaderboard over a CLOSED time window cannot change: the PRs
    // merged in August 2026 are fixed once August is over. So the cache
    // is not a staleness trade, it is the recognition that recomputing a
    // constant is waste -- and the waste is large, because recomputing
    // means the probe rounds and slice fetches of `github::stats::fetch`,
    // which cost requests against a 5,000/hour budget.
    //
    // `window_end` is what makes that safe, and it is why the row carries
    // the window rather than only a key: a caller can tell an answer about
    // a closed window (reusable forever) from one about a window that
    // includes today (reusable only briefly). The decision lives in
    // `store::stats`, not here, but the column it needs is here.
    //
    // # Columns
    //
    // `key` is `measure|subject|scope` from `StatsQuery::cache_key`, with
    // `@me` already RESOLVED to a login. That resolution is load-bearing:
    // two accounts on one machine share this file, and a row keyed on the
    // literal `@me` would serve one user's numbers to the other.
    //
    // `complete` is 0 when the answer was capped, refused, or assembled
    // from a plan that could not be fully retrieved -- #824 item 8
    // carried into storage, so a partial answer cannot be read back as a
    // confident one. A cached total whose partiality was forgotten is
    // worse than no cache: it launders a sample into a fact.
    //
    // `payload` is the serialised `Outcome` JSON, for the same reason
    // migration 8 puts per-core detail in a `detail` blob: it is only
    // ever read back whole, the shape will grow as #826 defines what a
