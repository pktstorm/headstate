//! The system-health series: writing samples, trimming to 24 hours, and
//! handing back a bounded history.
//!
//! # Why the history is downsampled here
//!
//! At one sample a minute the table holds ~1440 rows. Sending all of
//! them to draw a chart a few hundred pixels wide is waste on the
//! desktop and a real cost on the phone, which reads this over the LAN:
//! `size_worktrees` taught that lesson when a slow command over the
//! remote surface timed out at two minutes (#661). So the SQL picks a
//! bounded number of buckets and the caller cannot ask for more.
