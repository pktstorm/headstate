    //
    // The default `forks` pool builds a fresh environment for each of
    // the 141 test files, and that construction -- not the tests --
    // was the majority of the run: 152-159s of tracked time, 56%,
    // against a 27-28s wall-clock (environments overlap across
    // workers, so the total exceeds the duration). `vmThreads` runs
    // each file in its own V8 context inside a reused environment, so
    // the jsdom cost is paid once per worker instead of 141 times.
    // Measured locally: 27.9s -> 8.5s, and vitest's "jsdom was created
    // 141 times" advisory stops firing. Same 1549 tests across the
    // same 141 files, verified by diffing the full per-test JSON
    // report between the two pools rather than trusting the totals --
    // a config that quietly stopped collecting files would also look
    // like a speedup.
    //
    // `isolate: false` is the other option vitest suggests and is
    // faster still, but it shares ONE environment across files rather
    // than giving each its own context. This suite mocks modules
    // heavily (`vi.mock`, `vi.hoisted`) and several files mutate
    // module-level state, so that sharing leaks: tried, and 481 tests
    // failed, the Tauri IPC stub from one file bleeding into another's
    // `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__`. Rejected on that evidence, not on
    // principle. `vmThreads` keeps the per-file isolation those mocks
    // depend on, which is why it is the one that works here.

    // Not because any test is slow: 58% of this suite's wall-clock is
    // jsdom CONSTRUCTION -- 141 environments, one per test file, about
    // 154s of the 98s run (they overlap across workers). The default
    // budget is measured against a test whose own work is a fraction of
    // what surrounds it.
    //
    // A fully synchronous test in WorktreesPage.test.tsx -- render, then
    // assert, no await anywhere -- hit "Test timed out in 5000ms" on a
    // loaded Windows runner and blocked the v5.5.0 release, while 1548
    // of 1549 tests passed and a re-run of the same commit went green.
    // The whole 88-test file takes 2911ms when the runner is healthy:
    // inside the budget, with no margin, and the two runs of that one
    // commit differed by 1.5x on their own.
    //
    // The cost of raising it is that a genuinely hung test reports after
    // 15s instead of 5s. The cost of leaving it is a release blocked by
    // a test unrelated to the change being released. See #677, which
    // also tracks reducing the jsdom cost itself -- the actual wound,
    // of which this timeout is only the bleeding.

    // Coverage is available ON DEMAND (`yarn vitest run --coverage`) and
    // is NOT a gate. Kept deliberately, and the reasoning matters because
    // #853 proposed removing it outright.
    //
    // The argument for removal was a stale `coverage/` directory that
    // reported 91.81% over 403 lines across 32 files -- against 130
    // non-test source files totalling 33,394 lines (measured at this
    // commit; #853 recorded 132/33,390 when it was filed), so it
    // described about 1.2% of the frontend, from a run three weeks older
    // than the commit beside it. Anyone opening it to ask "is this area covered?" got a
    // confident number about almost none of the code.
    //
    // But the artifact was the problem, not the config: `coverage` is
    // already in `.gitignore` and was never tracked, so there is nothing
    // to delete from the repo -- the misleading directory was local to one
    // machine and a fresh run overwrites it.
    //
    // `thresholds` is deliberately NOT set, and no CI job runs this.
    // A threshold over the whole frontend would have to be set at
    // today's real number to pass, which nobody has measured, and a
    // threshold is a ratchet: it fails PRs that add well-tested code
    // beside untested code. The project's actual testing rule is the one
    // the suite already enforces -- 1,199 Rust tests and a frontend suite
    // that must be green -- not a percentage. Removing the block instead
    // would mean `--coverage` errors out for someone asking a legitimate
    // one-off question ("did my new file get exercised?"), which is the
    // only use this has ever had.
    //
    // So: no implied measurement, because nothing is committed and
    // nothing is gated; and the tool still works when asked.
