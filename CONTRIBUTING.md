# Contributing to Headstate

Thanks for taking a look. Headstate is a small, opinionated macOS app —
this doc covers the one rule you can't infer from the code, plus the
day-to-day workflow.

## The privacy rule (read this first)

**Headstate is a public repository.** Fixtures, screenshots, and
documentation must use synthetic data — `octocat/hello-world`,
`octocat/spoon-knife`, and similar, drawn from GitHub's own demo org. Never
commit a real repository name, PR title, branch name, or URL from a private
employer or private codebase. Once something is pushed to a public repo's
history, it's effectively permanent.

CI enforces this on every push and PR via `scripts/check-privacy.sh`, which
scans for `github.com/<owner>/<repo>` URLs, `git@github.com:<owner>/<repo>`
SSH remotes, `<owner>/<repo>#<number>` issue/PR shorthand, GitHub
Enterprise Server URLs, `ssh://git@<host>/...git` clone URLs to any host,
employer email addresses, Slack/Atlassian workspace URLs, and
`PREFIX-NNNN`-shaped internal ticket IDs.

This script is an **allow-list**, deliberately. A deny-list would have to
spell out the very names it exists to keep out — putting them in the repo
in plain text and defeating itself. An allow-list also catches owners
nobody thought to enumerate ahead of time. If you legitimately need to
reference a new public repository owner (a real upstream dependency, for
example), add it to the `ALLOWED` list at the top of the script rather than
working around the check.

Run the guard locally before you push:

```
./scripts/check-privacy.sh
```

It should print `privacy check: clean`. If it doesn't, fix the reference
(swap in synthetic data) rather than adding the real owner to the
allow-list unless it's genuinely a public, legitimate dependency.

The guard also refuses to run (exit 2) if you have **untracked files** in
the working tree. `git grep`, which the guard uses, can only see tracked
and staged content — an untracked file is invisible to it, so a "clean"
result while one exists would be false. Run `git add` (or `git add -N` to
stage without changing content) on any new files and re-run the guard.

## Workflow

Install dependencies once with `yarn install --immutable`, then use the
Makefile targets for everything:

```
make dev      # run the app locally with live reload
make test     # cargo test + yarn vitest run
make lint     # cargo fmt --check, clippy, tsc, eslint, knip
make fmt      # cargo fmt (writes, doesn't just check)
```

Run `make lint` and `make test` before opening a PR. Every CI check must be
green before merge — there's no fast-tracking a red check.

These targets are not the same thing as CI, and it's worth knowing where
they stop. `make lint` and `make test` cover the checks that answer in
seconds; CI additionally runs:

| What CI adds | Run it locally with |
| --- | --- |
| Race check — the Rust suite **three times** at `--test-threads=8` | `make test-race` |
| `cargo deny check` for `src-tauri` (supply chain) | `make deny` |
| `cargo check` for the Intel target the release also builds | `make check-intel` |
| `yarn npm audit` | *(no target — needs the npm advisories service)* |
| A full `tauri build`, and the Windows/Linux `platform` jobs | *(CI only)* |

The race check is the one to reach for when a test passes locally and fails
in CI: **one green run does not prove a race is absent**, which is exactly
why CI repeats the suite. The other two are cheap insurance before a
release, since an arch-gated link failure or a new advisory would otherwise
first appear at tag time.

Two guards that used to be CI-only now run in `make lint` (via
`lint-deps`): `scripts/check-privacy.sh` and
`scripts/check-workflow-shells.py`. The privacy one matters most, because
it scans **commit messages** as well as files — catching it locally means
an edit, and catching it in CI means an amend or an interactive rebase
after the content has already reached a public remote.

Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
(`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, etc.) — look at
`git log` for the pattern the project already uses.

## The `cargo build --release` trap

If you work in `src-tauri/`, do not run `cargo build --release` (or plain
`cargo build`) directly and expect it to produce a runnable app.

`cargo build` only compiles the Rust binary. It has no idea the project
also has a frontend, so it skips Tauri's `beforeBuildCommand` (`yarn
build`), which is what actually compiles the React app into `dist/` and
embeds it in the bundle. The result: a binary that's noticeably smaller
than a real build (no embedded JS/CSS/assets), and if you launch it, the
window opens and renders a blank **white screen** — before any JavaScript
ever loads, because the frontend was never built or embedded in the first
place. There's no error message; it just never shows anything.

This burned a real debugging session, which is why it's called out here
instead of left to be rediscovered. Always build through Tauri:

```
make build            # or: yarn tauri build
```

`cargo test` and `cargo clippy` are fine to run directly from `src-tauri/`
— it's specifically *building the app bundle* that needs to go through
`tauri build`, since only that path runs `beforeBuildCommand`.

## Two lints that keep catching people

**`items_after_test_module`.** Appending a new function or constant to the
end of a Rust file puts it *after* `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`, which clippy
rejects. It compiles and the tests pass, so it only fails at `make lint` —
and it has caught this project three times. Insert new items **before** the
test module, not at the end of the file.

**Your local Rust may be older than CI's.** `clippy::unnecessary_sort_by`
fired on CI's 1.98 while passing locally on 1.93.1. A clean local `make
lint` is necessary but not sufficient; if CI disagrees, check
`rustc --version` before assuming a flake.

## Cutting a release

Releases are driven entirely by tags. There is nothing to click and no
version to bump by hand:

```
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```

That fires `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which:

1. **Stamps the version from the tag** into `package.json`,
   `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`. The tag is the
   single source of truth — those three files stay at whatever they say in
   `main` and are only rewritten inside the CI job, never committed. Without
   this, tagging `v0.2.0` would ship `Headstate_0.1.0_universal.dmg` and an
   About box reading `0.1.0`.
2. Builds a **universal** binary (Apple Silicon + Intel), so one download
   runs on both.
3. Signs and notarizes it **if** the Apple secrets are present (see below).
   They are not today, so this step is skipped.
4. Creates the GitHub Release with the `.dmg` and a `.app.tar.gz`, and
   generates release notes from the commits since the last tag.

The tag must be `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Anything else (`v1.2`, `latest`,
`vfoo`) fails the job early with a clear message rather than publishing a
mislabelled build.

**The release notes adapt to the signing state on their own.** While
releases are unsigned, every release gets the `xattr -dr
com.apple.quarantine` instruction prepended automatically. Once the signing
secrets exist, that text is replaced with a note that the build is signed
and notarized — no edit to the workflow, and no stale instruction left
behind for users to follow unnecessarily.

To undo a bad tag before anyone downloads it, delete it locally and
remotely (`git tag -d v0.2.0 && git push origin :v0.2.0`) and delete the
GitHub Release. Re-tagging the same version works, but only if the release
and tag are both gone first.

## Code signing

macOS releases are **signed and notarized** as of v5.3.0. The steps live
in `.github/workflows/release.yml`, guarded on the secrets below, so a
fork without them still builds unsigned rather than failing. These are
the secrets the signing path reads (Settings → Secrets and variables →
Actions):

| Secret | What it is |
|---|---|
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` | Base64-encoded `.p12` export of a **Developer ID Application** certificate (not Apple Distribution, not Apple Development — those don't work for distribution outside the App Store) |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | The password the `.p12` was exported with |
| `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` | Any password; used only for the throwaway keychain CI creates to hold the imported cert |
| `APPLE_ID` | The Apple ID email used for notarization |
| `APPLE_PASSWORD` | An [app-specific password](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204397) for that Apple ID — not the account password |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | The Apple Developer Team ID (found on the [membership page](https://developer.apple.com/account/#/membership)) |

`APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` is deliberately not listed as a secret to set —
Tauri infers it from the imported `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` at build time, so
there's nothing to hardcode ahead of having a real certificate.

Verify a release actually got signed rather than trusting a green build —
the workflow takes the unsigned path silently when a secret is missing:

```
spctl -a -vvv -t install /Volumes/Headstate/Headstate.app
```

`accepted` with `source=Notarized Developer ID` is the answer you want.
`xcrun stapler validate` on the same path confirms the ticket is stapled,
which is what lets the app launch on a machine with no network.

Notarization adds real time to the macOS job: it waits on Apple's
service, and the first submission from a new signing identity took about
an hour where the build alone takes twelve minutes. Later ones are
usually far quicker.

Headstate started strictly read-only. Since the write path landed it can
also act on a pull request — merge, close, mark as draft, enqueue,
approve, request changes, comment, resolve or reply to a review thread,
re-run checks, update the branch, toggle auto-merge, and open a
package-update PR — but **only when you click that action in the app**.
Nothing runs on a timer, nothing is batched, and each write goes through
one module (`src-tauri/src/github/mutate.rs`) so the full list is in one
place. If you're proposing a change that would have Headstate write to
GitHub on its own initiative, expect that to be a bigger conversation
about scope, not a quick PR.
