"""Every Kotlin `@Command` method must be a name Rust actually invokes.

Tauri's Android `PluginHandle` dispatches on the **literal** `@Command`
method name -- `commands[method.name]`, with no case conversion. So a
Kotlin `fun acquire_lock` where Rust calls `acquireLock` is a runtime
`InvokeException` and nothing at compile time. Nothing at all catches it
today: the `mobile-android` job cross-compiles the Rust, generates the
Android Studio project, asserts `build.gradle.kts` exists, and stops. It
never runs Gradle, so no Kotlin is compiled in CI.

That was nearly shipped in #696, whose first draft used snake_case wire
names. The failure mode would have been an mDNS browse that silently
returns nothing -- exactly the bug #696 exists to fix, replaced by an
identically silent one, with green CI throughout.

#696 also established the convention this check reads: Rust holds the
names as constants in a `pub mod cmd` (`cmd::ACQUIRE_MULTICAST =
"acquireMulticast"`) with a test pinning the literals, rather than
spelling them at each call site. This compares that set against the
Kotlin methods, in both directions.

What it does NOT do is compile Kotlin. A `./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin`
step would catch typos, wrong API members, and missing imports as well --
strictly stronger, and issue #698 raises it. It is not here because it
needs a full Android SDK plus a Gradle run on a job that already takes
minutes, to catch a class of error that a reviewer reading a diff can see,
whereas the name mismatch is invisible in review precisely because both
sides look correct in isolation. This check costs milliseconds and needs
no JVM. If the Kotlin grows past two plugins' worth, revisit.

iOS is deliberately not checked here: `mobile-ios` builds the IPA, and
that compiles Swift, so a Swift selector mismatch is a build failure
already. Swift is also allowed to implement FEWER commands than Rust
names -- `acquireMulticast` is Android-only, since the Wi-Fi multicast
lock has no iOS equivalent.

Parses with regexes rather than a Kotlin or Rust parser, the same
tradeoff `check-workflow-shells.py` makes: the lint runner has no
third-party packages, and a guard that needs its own install is a guard
that gets dropped. The two questions asked -- "which `fun` follows an
`@Command`" and "which `&str` constants live in `mod cmd`" -- are narrow
enough for that to be sound on machine-consistent, `cargo fmt`-formatted
and ktlint-formatted sources.
