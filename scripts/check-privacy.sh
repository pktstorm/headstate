# This is an ALLOW-list, deliberately. A deny-list would have to spell out
# the very names it exists to keep out, putting them in the repo in plain
# text and defeating itself. An allow-list also catches owners nobody
# thought to enumerate.
#
# Two patterns are scanned, both anchored so they cannot match ordinary
# prose. An earlier unanchored `owner/repo` pattern matched things like
# `api/hooks.ts`, `read/write`, and `5000/hour` -- a gate that cries wolf
# gets disabled, so anchoring is load-bearing, not tidiness.
