"""The mobile jobs' path gate must be wired so it can only fail LOUDLY.

`mobile-android` and `mobile-ios` are required checks that skip their own
steps when a pull request touches no mobile code. A required check that
does not RUN blocks a merge forever, so the jobs always run and report
under their exact required names; what is conditional is their steps.

That shape has one catastrophic failure mode, and it is silent. Every
step is gated on `needs.mobile-changes.outputs.run == 'true'`. If a job
ever loses its `needs: mobile-changes`, that expression does not error --
it evaluates to the empty string, which is not `'true'`, so EVERY step is
skipped on EVERY run and the job reports green having compiled nothing.
Mobile would then be unverified indefinitely with a fully green board,
which is precisely the outcome the path filter was written not to cause.

The mirror-image failure is a step added later without the gate: that one
is merely wasteful (the job does work it was meant to skip) but it also
means the job is no longer honestly described by this comment, so it is
checked too.

Deliberately parses by indentation rather than importing PyYAML, the same
tradeoff `check-workflow-shells.py` makes: the lint runner has no
third-party Python packages, and a guard that needs its own install is a
guard that gets dropped.

The set of gated jobs is DERIVED, not listed. It was hardcoded as
`("mobile-android", "mobile-ios")`, which meant a third gated job added
later was not checked at all and this guard still printed success --
a guard silently not covering the thing it exists to cover, which is the
same failure shape as the bug it hunts (#853).

`needs: mobile-changes` is the right thing to key off because it is
exactly the load-bearing wire: a job that declares it is a job whose
steps read `needs.mobile-changes.outputs.run`, and a job that drops it is
the catastrophic case above. Deriving from `needs` cannot miss a new job,
and cannot go stale. The floor below keeps the derivation itself honest:
an empty result would otherwise pass vacuously, which is the same
"scanned nothing, reported clean" failure the privacy guard aborts on
(check-privacy.sh, 'Abort loudly instead').
